## Page Prioritization Methods

### 1. AI-Powered Ranking (Default)

When `USE_AI_RANKING=true` and OpenAI API key is provided:

__Priority Order:__

1. Documentation, guides, and informational pages
2. Product/service pages
3. About and company information pages
4. Blog posts and articles
5. __Avoids__: Login pages, external links, social media, contact forms

__How it works__ (`ai_link_ranker.py`):

- Sends discovered links to OpenAI API
- AI analyzes URL structure and link text
- Returns ranked list based on content importance
- Crawler scrapes pages in AI-determined order

### 2. Natural Order (Fallback)

When AI ranking is disabled or no API key:

- Pages scraped in order they appear on homepage
- Links at top of page are scraped first
- Follows natural HTML/DOM order
