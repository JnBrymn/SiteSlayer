SUBJECT: Helping Lifetime Dentistry Answer Patient Questions Instantly

-----------------------------------------

Hi Dr. Hernandez,

I’m always impressed by how Lifetime Dentistry blends advanced dental care with genuine, patient-centered support—everything from digital CEREC technology to the focus on comfort during new patient visits stands out.

My name is Zac, and I lead SlayDigital.ai. We build simple, custom AI web agents that let site visitors chat directly with your existing website content—helping answer patient questions quickly, day or night.

To show what this could look like for your practice, I set up a demo using your own site:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/lifetimedentistrytn_com  
Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right, type a dental question, and the agent will reply using your site’s information.

You can try asking:
- “Are you accepting new patients, and how do I schedule my first appointment?”
- “What’s the difference between dental implants, bridges, and dentures?”
- “Do you accept my dental insurance, and what payment options are available?”
- “What should I expect on my first visit?”
- “Who will my dentist be, and can I choose who I see?”

If you think instant answers could help relieve your team and support even more patient connections, I’d be glad to hear your thoughts—or set up a quick call if you like.

Best regards,  
Zac
