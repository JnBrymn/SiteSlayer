-----------------------------------------
Hello Lifetime Dentistry team,

I was impressed by the way you guide patients through everything from routine checkups to advanced restorative care—your focus on patient confidence and comfort really shines through.

I’m Zac, founder of SlayDigital.ai. We help local practices like yours reduce repetitive questions and make it even easier for new and returning patients to get the information they need. We do this by adding a simple AI web chat agent that answers visitor questions using your own website content—no complicated setup or confusing tech talk.

I put together a quick demo for you here: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/lifetimedentistrytn_com  
You’ll see a chat icon at the bottom-right. Just click it, type a common patient question, and the agent will reply using info from your site.

You can try asking things like:
- What insurance plans do you accept?
- How do I schedule a new patient appointment?
- What’s included in a professional teeth cleaning?
- Do you offer dental implants, and how do they work?
- What are your hours and location?

Would love to hear your thoughts. If this looks useful, let me know—I’m happy to answer questions or set up a quick call.

All the best,  
Zac
