SUBJECT: Helping Patients Find the Right Info—A Simple Chat Agent for Lifetime Dentistry

-----------------------------------------

Hi Dr. Hernandez,

I love how Lifetime Dentistry focuses on restoring confidence and comfort for patients—your commitment to personalized, advanced dental care really comes through.

I’m Zac, founder of SlayDigital.ai. We build simple web chat agents that let your site visitors ask questions and get instant answers—using only the information already on your own website. It’s a helpful way to handle common questions, reduce calls, and help patients quickly understand your offerings.

I’ve created a quick demo using a mock version of your site: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/lifetimedentistrytn_com  
Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right to open the chat box, then try typing your questions. The agent pulls answers from your actual site content.

Here are some questions your own patients might try:
- What dental insurance plans do you accept?
- How soon can I schedule a new patient appointment?
- What’s the difference between implants and dentures?
- Do you offer same-day crowns with CEREC?
- What should I expect at my first visit?

If you’d like to see how a tool like this could make your patient experience even smoother, just reply—I’d be happy to chat further or set up a custom version for Lifetime Dentistry.

Warm regards,  
Zac
