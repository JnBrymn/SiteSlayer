SUBJECT: Helping Patients Get Fast Answers On Your Site—See Our Live Demo

-----------------------------------------

Hi Dr. Hernandez,

I’m continually impressed by Lifetime Dentistry’s focus on personal, patient-centered care and your commitment to advanced technology. I wanted to share a simple way to make it even easier for your current and future patients to get answers right on your website—without any extra work for your team.

At SlayDigital.ai, we build custom AI web agents that let visitors chat directly with your website’s information (no jargon or complex setup). I created a quick demo using your site here: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/lifetimedentistrytn_com

Just look for the chat icon in the lower-right corner, click it, and type your questions to see instant, site-based responses.

You can try asking things like:
- Are you accepting new patients, and what can I expect at my first visit?
- What insurance plans do you accept, and do you offer payment options?
- How do dental implants compare to bridges or dentures?
- What is the process and cost for clear aligner treatment?
- Can I schedule a same-day cleaning or emergency appointment?

This kind of tool can reduce repetitive questions and help more visitors understand their options—while keeping your warm approach front and center.

If you’re curious how this could work for Lifetime Dentistry or want to customize answers further, just reply—I’m happy to help and there’s zero pressure.

Wishing you and your team continued success,

Zac
