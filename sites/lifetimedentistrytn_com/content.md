### Technology & Partnership

Our practice is differentiated by our pursuit of education and technology. In our hands, these innovations offer patients a superior standard of care.

![Cerec](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cerec.png)

CEREC is a technology used by dentists to design, create, and place ceramic restorations such as [crowns](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/general-dentistry/crowns/), inlays, onlays, and [veneers](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/cosmetic-dentistry/veneers/) in just one appointment. The technology uses computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) software and a milling machine to create the restoration from a solid block of ceramic material.

CEREC matters to patients because it provides several benefits, such as convenience and comfort, since the entire process can be completed in a single visit instead of requiring multiple appointments. Patients do not have to wear temporary restorations or go through the process of taking impressions and sending them to a dental lab, which can be uncomfortable and time-consuming. CEREC restorations are often considered more aesthetically pleasing and durable than traditional restorations.

![Dentsply Sirona](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dentals.png)

Dentsply Sirona is a global dental equipment and technology company that provides dental professionals with a wide range of products and services. They offer solutions for various dental specialties, including general dentistry, orthodontics, endodontics, and implant dentistry.

Dentsply Sirona’s technology and products may be used in dental treatments, such as implants, restorations, and orthodontic appliances. By working with dental professionals who use Dentsply Sirona’s products and technology, patients may benefit from more precise and efficient treatments, resulting in better outcomes and potentially less discomfort during procedures.

![Spear Education](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/spear.png)

Spear Education is a leading provider of continuing education and clinical resources for dentists and dental professionals. The organization offers courses and workshops covering various topics, from clinical techniques to practice management and marketing.
