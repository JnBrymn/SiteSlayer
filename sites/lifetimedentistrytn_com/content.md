### Technology & Partnership

Our practice is differentiated by our pursuit of education and technology. In our hands, these innovations offer patients a superior standard of care.

CEREC is a technology used by dentists to design, create, and place ceramic restorations such as [crowns](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/general-dentistry/crowns/), inlays, onlays, and [veneers](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/cosmetic-dentistry/veneers/) in just one appointment. The technology uses computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) software and a milling machine to create the restoration from a solid block of ceramic material.

Dr Hernandez and his team have the highest standards and I have had a renewed faith in dentistry since becoming a client some years ago.I travel to be seen at his practice. Recently I had my teeth cleaned by Jennifer, she is meticulous and I am lucky to have found her! If for any reason you have been putting off a dental visit make an appointment! You will be very well taken care of here and be in very good hands! Thank you very much! Moira
