Dr Hernandez and his team have the highest standards and I have had a renewed faith in dentistry since becoming a client some years ago.I travel to be seen at his practice. Recently I had my teeth cleaned by Jennifer, she is meticulous and I am lucky to have found her! If for any reason you have been putting off a dental visit make an appointment! You will be very well taken care of here and be in very good hands! Thank you very much! Moira
