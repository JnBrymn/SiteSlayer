Dr Hernandez and his team have the highest standards and I have had a renewed faith in dentistry since becoming a client some years ago.I travel to be seen at his practice. Recently I had my teeth cleaned by Jennifer, she is meticulous and I am lucky to have found her! If for any reason you have been putting off a dental visit make an appointment! You will be very well taken care of here and be in very good hands! Thank you very much! Moira

## Cosmetic Dentistry

If you’re not satisfied with your smile, our Cosmetic Dentistry services can transform the appearance of your teeth. We offer professional teeth whitening, bonding, veneers, and more.


[Teeth Bonding](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/cosmetic-dentistry/teeth-bonding/)


A versatile procedure that can target many dental imperfections, including chips, cracks, discoloration or staining, minor gaps, and inconsistent tooth sizes or shapes.
[Learn More](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/cosmetic-dentistry/teeth-bonding/)

[Teeth Whitening](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/cosmetic-dentistry/teeth-whitening/)


A convenient and fast process of removing stains or discoloration from natural tooth enamel, leaving you with a brighter smile.
[Learn More](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/cosmetic-dentistry/teeth-whitening/)


[Dental Botox](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/cosmetic-dentistry/dental-botox/)


Tense jaw muscles can cause grinding and clenching of teeth, leading to pain, bite problems, and other complications. Dentists use BOTOX® therapeutically to relax those muscles. This relieves discomfort and prevents the damage that stems from bruxism.
[Learn More](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/cosmetic-dentistry/dental-botox/)


## General Dentistry

Our General Dentistry services include oral exams, cleanings, and restorative work to maintain the health and appearance of your smile.


[Bridges](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/general-dentistry/bridges/)


Dental bridges bridge the gap created by one or more missing teeth and are made up of two or more crowns for the teeth on either side of the gap.
[Learn More](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/general-dentistry/bridges/)

[Crowns](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/general-dentistry/crowns/)


Crowns are durable shields placed over a damaged tooth to protect it. Made to look like a normal tooth, you can fill in your smile and protect your teeth as much as possible.
[Learn More](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/general-dentistry/crowns/)

[Dentures](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/general-dentistry/dentures/)


Dentures are an effective option for patients with missing teeth who want to enjoy the appearance and functionality of a full smile. If you’re missing all of the teeth on your upper or lower jaw, full dentures may be right for you.
[Learn More](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/general-dentistry/dentures/)

[Dental Fillings](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/general-dentistry/dental-fillings/)


Composite restorations, commonly known as “fillings,” help restore and strengthen a damaged tooth. This is often used for teeth that have succumbed to decay or trauma or have worn down over time.
[Learn More](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/general-dentistry/dental-fillings/)

[Professional Teeth Cleaning](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/general-dentistry/professional-teeth-cleaning/)


Maintaining good oral health at home is important, but getting your teeth cleaned regularly by your dentist helps detect cavities and early signs of gum disease or oral cancer.
[Learn More](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/general-dentistry/professional-teeth-cleaning/)

## Complete Dentistry

Did you know your oral condition can have a huge impact on your overall health? With complete health dentistry, you can take control of your well-being.


[Dental Sealants](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/complete-dentistry/dental-sealants/)


Protect your teeth or your child’s teeth from decay and plaque with a clear dental sealant.
[Learn More](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/complete-dentistry/dental-sealants/)

[Oral Cancer Screening](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/complete-dentistry/oral-cancer-screening/)


Early detection can make all the difference, which is why we offer cancer screenings for patients who may be at risk of developing oral cancer.
[Learn More](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/complete-dentistry/oral-cancer-screening/)

[Periodontal (Gum) Disease Therapy](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/complete-dentistry/gum-disease/)

A potentially serious sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts.
[Learn More](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/complete-dentistry/sleep-apnea/)

[Mouthguards](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/complete-dentistry/mouthguards/)


Mouthguards may also be necessary for patients who suffer from clenching or grinding their teeth at night. Custom guards are beneficial for all ages, including children and teens who play high school sports.
[Learn More](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/complete-dentistry/mouthguards/)

## Surgical Dentistry

Whether you need a root canal, dental implants, or a tooth extraction, Surgical Dentistry can help you achieve your oral health goals.


[Tooth Extractions](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/surgical-dentistry/tooth-extractions/)


The removal of a tooth that is visible in your mouth due to excessive tooth decay, tooth infection, and crowding.
[Learn More](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/surgical-dentistry/tooth-extractions/)

[Dental Infections](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/surgical-dentistry/dental-infections/)


A dental infection (tooth abscess) originates at the tooth or its supporting structures and can spread to the surrounding tissue. A tooth abscess is the result of bacterial infections causing a pocket of pus to form in different regions of the tooth or gums.
[Learn More](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/surgical-dentistry/dental-infections/)

[Root Canals](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/surgical-dentistry/root-canals/)


Inside the core enamel layer in your teeth, the pulp can sometimes become infected, inflamed, and cause severe pain. A root canal procedure is necessary to clean out the decay when this happens.
[Learn More](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/surgical-dentistry/root-canals/)

## Emergency Dental Treatment

We can treat a variety of traumatic dental injuries, including teeth that have been chipped, moved, or knocked out entirely. Please call our office for assistance. If you have a life-threatening or severe injury, call 9-1-1 or go directly to the nearest hospital emergency room.

[Learn More](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/emergency-dentistry/)

### Technology & Partnership

Our practice is differentiated by our pursuit of education and technology. In our hands, these innovations offer patients a superior standard of care.

CEREC is a technology used by dentists to design, create, and place ceramic restorations such as [crowns](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/general-dentistry/crowns/), inlays, onlays, and [veneers](https://lifetimedentistrytn.com/services/cosmetic-dentistry/veneers/) in just one appointment. The technology uses computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) software and a milling machine to create the restoration from a solid block of ceramic material.

CEREC matters to patients because it provides several benefits, such as convenience and comfort, since the entire process can be completed in a single visit instead of requiring multiple appointments. Patients do not have to wear temporary restorations or go through the process of taking impressions and sending them to a dental lab, which can be uncomfortable and time-consuming. CEREC restorations are often considered more aesthetically pleasing and durable than traditional restorations.

Dentsply Sirona is a global dental equipment and technology company that provides dental professionals with a wide range of products and services. They offer solutions for various dental specialties, including general dentistry, orthodontics, endodontics, and implant dentistry.

Dentsply Sirona’s technology and products may be used in dental treatments, such as implants, restorations, and orthodontic appliances. By working with dental professionals who use Dentsply Sirona’s products and technology, patients may benefit from more precise and efficient treatments, resulting in better outcomes and potentially less discomfort during procedures.

Spear Education is a leading provider of continuing education and clinical resources for dentists and dental professionals. The organization offers courses and workshops covering various topics, from clinical techniques to practice management and marketing.

They are committed to advancing the quality of dental care through education and training. Spear Education helps ensure patients receive the best care by providing dentists with the latest knowledge and skills. Patients can have confidence in a dentist who has undergone training with Spear Education, as it indicates a commitment to staying up-to-date with the latest techniques and technologies in the field.

Professional Dental Implants in Nashville, TN


# Dental Implants Restore Your Smile and Mouth Function

Dental implant surgery replaces missing or damaged teeth, including the tooth root, with artificial teeth that look and function just like real ones.

## Dental Implant vs Bridge

This video shows you the differences between a bridge and a dental implant to replace a missing tooth, while reviewing the benefits and potential drawbacks of each.

## Implants Replace Missing Teeth and Improve Oral Health

Despite improvements in dental care, many people suffer tooth loss — mostly due to [tooth infections](/services/surgical-dentistry/dental-infections/), [tooth decay](/services/general-dentistry/dental-fillings/), [periodontal disease (gum disease)](/services/complete-dentistry/gum-disease/), or injury. The only treatment options available for people with missing teeth were [bridges](/services/general-dentistry/bridges/) and dentures for many years. Today, the space left by a missing tooth can be filled with a dental implant.

## Learn More About Dental Implants at Lifetime Dentistry

## What are Dental Implants?

A dental implant is an artificial tooth, including the tooth root. An implant is anchored in the jawbone below the gum line, providing a strong foundation for the replacement tooth. Implants have the look and feel of natural teeth, allowing patients to regain confidence in their smile.

Artificial teeth for dental implants can be permanent or removable, and implants can support [crowns](/services/general-dentistry/crowns/), [bridges](/services/general-dentistry/bridges/), or [dentures](/services/general-dentistry/dentures/). Your [dentist](/about/) can discuss which type of implant is right for you.

## How are Dental Implants Inserted?

Dental implant surgery is usually performed in stages, with healing time between procedures. The surgical dentistry required for an implant may be performed by your dentist or an oral surgeon.

The process of placing a dental implant includes the following:

- Developing a treatment plan. To determine if you’re a good candidate for dental implants, your dentist will consider factors such as how many teeth you need to be replaced and the condition of your jawbone, [your bite], and remaining teeth. Upon completion of an examination, your dentist will explain which type of treatment plan is the best option for you.
- Damaged tooth removal. To prepare the site for the implant, bone grafting may be recommended to ready the area for the future implant.
- Jawbone preparation (grafting) when needed. A prosthetic tooth requires an adequate jawbone in which to anchor. If your jawbone is too thin or soft, a bone graft will be required. Options include a natural bone graft from another location in your body or a synthetic bone graft, such as bone-substitute material that can provide support structures for new bone growth.
- Dental implant placement. The tooth root implant, which is a small post made of titanium, is placed into the missing tooth’s bone socket.
- Bone growth and healing. As the jawbone heals, it grows around the implanted metal post. This will support the implant when you chew or bite down. The healing process typically takes 3-6 months.
- Abutment placement. Once the implant has bonded and integrated into the jawbone, a small connector post — called an abutment — is attached to the post to hold the new tooth securely.
- Artificial tooth placement. A replacement tooth, made from digital impressions of your teeth, is then secured onto the abutment.

## How Long Do Dental Implants Last?

Success rates of dental implants vary, depending on where in the jaw the implants are placed and the risk factors of the individual, but in general, implants have a success rate of up to 98%. With proper oral hygiene and management of risk factors, implants can last a lifetime.

## The Pros and Cons of Dental Implants

The advantages of dental implants include:

- Stability. Because the implant is anchored in the jawbone, it’s as stable as a natural tooth.
- No bone loss. Preservation of jaw bone (implants are not guaranteed to prevent all bone loss). The implant enables your jaw to retain bone matter at the site of the lost tooth.
- Balancing function: replacement of a missing tooth or teeth benefits all teeth in the mouth by way of distributing forces more evenly over all teeth over time
- Improved oral health. Implants can be brushed and flossed like a natural tooth, allowing patients to maintain good oral health.
- Appearance. Depending on the site of the lost tooth, a bridge may be noticeable to others, impacting self-confidence. An implant looks just like a natural tooth.
- Durability. With proper care, implants are likely to last longer than bridges or dentures — possibly for life.

The disadvantages of implants include the following:

- An invasive procedure. An implant requires dental surgery, where the gums are cut open at the site of the lost tooth, and a hole is drilled into the jawbone to hold the titanium post.
- Longer healing time. An implant requires several visits to the dentist and several months of healing time between appointments.
- Cost. Implants are more expensive than [bridges](/services/general-dentistry/bridges/) or [dentures](/services/general-dentistry/dentures/) and typically aren’t covered by most insurance plans.

Porcelain Dental Veneers in Nashville, TN | Lifetime Dentistry


# Fix Cosmetic Dental Issues With Veneers

Dental veneers are thin, porcelain wafers placed over the tooth surface to fix the appearance of cracked, chipped, stained, or misaligned teeth.

## Veneers

This video shows you how veneers are used to improve the appearance of a smile, using CAD/CAM 3-D technology to create custom-made restorations.

## Veneers Look and Feel Like Natural Teeth

Have you ever wondered why celebrities have such perfect teeth? They weren’t all just born lucky — many of them have veneers. But veneers aren’t only for the famous — they can improve the appearance of anyone with cracked, stained, misaligned, or chipped teeth. Veneers look and feel natural, and they don’t require any special dental care, which is why they’re so popular with patients wanting to address cosmetic issues with their smile.

## Learn More About Veneers at Lifetime Dentistry

## What Are Dental Veneers?

Dental veneers are wafer-thin, custom-made shells of tooth-colored materials designed to improve your appearance. Unlike [crowns](/services/general-dentistry/crowns/), which cover the entire tooth, veneers are only used on the front surface, so there’s much less preparation involved and minimal loss of the natural tooth structure.

Veneers can improve the color, shape, or size of a tooth. They can be bonded onto any number of teeth, though they’re usually only placed on teeth at the front of the mouth, where patients have the most cosmetic concerns. Once they are bonded, veneers will stay in place for many years and be virtually undetectable.

Dental veneers can be made from porcelain or from resin composite material. Porcelain veneers last longer and resist stains better than resin veneers. They also better mimic the light-reflecting properties of natural teeth. Your dentist can help you decide which type of veneer is right for you.

Veneers are routinely used to fix:

- Teeth that are chipped or broken
- Teeth that are misaligned, uneven, or irregularly shaped
- Teeth with gaps between them to close the space between teeth
- Teeth that are discolored due to medications, root canal treatment, excessive fluoride, or other causes
- Teeth that are worn down

## How Are Porcelain Veneers Placed?

To prepare your teeth for porcelain veneers, your dentist will remove a thin layer of tooth enamel to make space for the veneer. Your dentist may numb the area before trimming off the enamel.

Next, your [dentist](/about/) will make an impression of your teeth. This may be done with CAD/CAM 3D technology, in which case your veneers can be made and bonded to your teeth in one visit to the dental office. Alternatively, a model of your teeth is sent to a dental laboratory, which then makes your veneers. In this instance, you will be fitted with temporary veneers until your permanent veneers are ready.

When your veneers are ready, your dentist will bond them to your teeth and make any necessary adjustments so they look and feel like natural teeth.

## Composite Resin Veneers

Composite veneers are sculpted directly onto your natural tooth with a white-colored resin. They typically require minimal tooth preparation, so they may be reversible in some cases. And since they are often completed in one day, patients do not need to wear temporary veneers.

Composite veneers cost less than porcelain veneers, but they come with some potential drawbacks. For example, composite veneers are not as strong as porcelain and may not be appropriate in higher-wear situations. Composite veneers also typically have a shorter lifespan than their porcelain counterparts, and they may not be able to cover imperfections to the same degree.

## Before You Get Veneers

Before you get veneers, your oral health should be medically reviewed. Your [dentist](/about/ "About Us") will want to examine your teeth and gums to ensure that they are healthy. Veneers may not be the right solution for you if you grind or clench your teeth, as this may damage veneers. Or your dentist may recommend that you wear a [mouthguard](/services/complete-dentistry/mouthguards/) if you get veneers to reduce the risk of damage.

Your dentist will also ensure that veneers are the best option to treat the cosmetic concerns you have: in some cases, [teeth whitening](/services/cosmetic-dentistry/teeth-whitening/), [crowns](/services/general-dentistry/crowns/), or other dental procedures may be the better treatment choice, depending on your goals for your smile.

While dental veneers are suitable for adult teeth, they are not advised for baby teeth.

## Caring For Your Veneers

No special care is required for your veneers — they can be maintained simply by brushing and flossing each day. Patients should also see their dentist regularly to ensure veneers are functioning optimally and to maintain good oral hygiene.


If cosmetic issues with your teeth are impacting your smile and your confidence, [contact us today](/contact-us/) to schedule a consultation. Veneers could give you the flawless smile you’ve always wanted!


Clear Aligners | Lifetime Dentistry


# Clear Aligner Treatment for a Beautiful Smile

Clear aligners are thin, removable plastic mouthpieces that are designed to help guide teeth into their proper position, giving patients an alternative to traditional braces.

## Clear Aligners

Clear aligners are an alternative to traditional braces and are designed to help guide teeth into their proper position. The removable aligners are made of a strong, near-invisible plastic material and are fabricated to fit each individual’s mouth. Popular examples: Invisalign, ClearCorrect

## The Easy Way to Straighten Your Teeth

Everybody wants a great smile, but many of us need help from a dentist or orthodontist to achieve it. For decades, metal braces were the standard treatment process to correct misaligned and crowded teeth. But now, clear teeth aligners make it easy to attain your dream smile.

## Learn More About Clear Aligners at Lifetime Dentistry

## What Are Clear Aligners?

Clear aligners are thin, removable plastic mouthpieces that secure closely to your teeth and gently move them into the correct position. Your dentist might recommend them to improve the appearance of your smile, adjust your bite, make it easier for you to brush and floss, or do all of the above.

Popular examples of clear aligners include Invisalign and [SureSmile®](https://www.suresmile.com/en-us/), though there are numerous other brands.

## How Do Clear Aligners Work?

To create clear aligners for your mouth, your dentist will make a 3-D scan or impression of your teeth, then several sets of aligners will be made according to your custom treatment plan. Your dentist will determine how many sets of invisible aligners you’ll require to address your dental issues.

Once your aligners are ready, tiny, tooth-colored attachments are temporarily bonded onto specific teeth to hold the aligners in place as they move the teeth. The attachments are barely visible when you smile, and most patients quickly get used to them.

Depending on the orthodontic treatment you require, your dentist may also recommend using small elastics to help move the teeth into position. These elastics are held in place by tiny hooks, which are also temporarily bonded onto teeth in places where they don’t interfere with chewing and where they usually aren’t noticeable.

Once each aligner has accomplished its task of incremental tooth movement, you’ll replace it with the next aligner, usually every couple of weeks.

Treatment time with clear aligners is based on how much the teeth need to be moved. The more your bite is misaligned or the more crooked your teeth, the longer it will take. Typical treatment time is between 10 and 24 months — but if you’re an adult who had braces as a child and your teeth have only shifted slightly over the years, you may need aligners for as little as a few months.

## Advantages of Clear Aligners vs. Traditional Braces

With traditional braces, patients live with a mouthful of metal 24 hours a day, often for years. They need to see an orthodontist regularly to adjust the braces as teeth move. Brushing and flossing can also be a challenge with metal braces.

There are many reasons to love clear aligners. They are extremely inconspicuous, having almost no noticeable impact on your appearance. They can also be removed — so it’s easier to eat or drink, and you don’t have to deprive yourself of any foods that may be restricted by braces. And unlike braces, clear aligners can easily be taken out to maintain good oral hygiene.

Patients with clear aligners require fewer visits to a dental office than those with braces. Depending on the length of treatment, patients may have to return simply to have new impressions or scans taken of their teeth to create additional sets of aligners once the initial phase of treatment is completed.

While it’s recommended that clear aligners be worn for up to 22 hours per day, most patients find them to be very comfortable, as they don’t have any sharp metal components.

And clear aligners are easily maintained with gentle brushing with a toothbrush and water.

## Are You a Candidate for Clear Aligner Treatment?

Clear aligners are typically used for patients with mild to moderate teeth crowding or minor alignment or spacing issues. Patients who have severe crowding or spacing problems, or severe underbites, overbites, or crossbites, may require more complex treatment.

Clear aligners are best for adults or teenagers. Straightening a child’s teeth is more complicated — children, and their mouths, are constantly developing, and younger kids may struggle with having attachments on teeth and remaining compliant with maintaining the condition of aligners.


The smile you’ve always wanted can be yours with little discomfort, inconvenience, or self-consciousness. If you think you’re a good candidate for clear aligners, [contact us](/contact-us/) today to book a consultation. Your dentist will be happy to examine your mouth and discuss whether clear aligners are right for you, and our office staff can provide you with information on treatment costs and [payment plan options](/insurance/).


Professional Teeth Cleaning Service in Nashville, TN


# Professional Teeth Cleaning Maintains Oral Health


## Dental Checkups & Cleanings

Many oral health problems don’t present symptoms during their early stages, meaning that most patients don’t notice something until an issue is already quite advanced and difficult to treat. To save you from this kind of headache, we recommend getting at least two checkups and cleanings each year. These appointments will enable our dentists to find and treat any dental decay or damage as early as possible. A dedicated cleaning will remove harmful plaque and tartar from those hard-to-reach areas in your mouth to stop cavities before they even start.

## Advanced Plaque and Tartar Removal is Essential

One of the most important things you can do for your overall health is to keep your teeth and gums healthy. Brushing your teeth twice a day and flossing at least once is critical — but another important part of maintaining good oral health is getting your teeth professionally cleaned.

The American Dental Association recommends regular dental visits, including teeth cleanings, to maintain optimal oral health.

## Learn More About Professional Teeth Cleaning in

## What Is A Professional Teeth Cleaning?

During professional teeth cleanings, your dentist or dental hygienist uses special tools to remove plaque and tartar from your teeth, deep-brush your teeth, and apply a fluoride treatment to your teeth. This type of cleaning isn’t possible to achieve with at-home hygiene practices.

A professional cleaning of your teeth is essential to prevent cavities, tooth decay, and [gum disease (periodontitis)](/services/complete-dentistry/gum-disease/).

## What Types of Dental Cleanings Are There?

There are four types of dental cleanings:

- Prophylaxis Dental Cleaning. The word prophylaxis means “to prevent disease.” Therefore, prophylaxis dental cleanings are used to clean healthy teeth in order to prevent them from becoming affected by tooth decay or gum disease. Prophylaxis cleanings remove plaque and tartar from teeth using a dental scaler or water stream. Most dental patients only require a prophylaxis cleaning, especially if they have kept up with daily dental hygiene and semi-annual dental appointments.
- Scaling and Root Planing Cleaning. Scaling and root planing cleanings, also known as deep cleanings, are used for both teeth and gum pockets in order to treat gingivitis (inflamed gums) and periodontitis (gum disease). Scaling is the process that removes plaque and tartar from the tooth’s surface and in the gum pockets below the gum line. This removes bacteria and helps to reduce gum inflammation. Root planing is the process of smoothing the tooth roots, which helps the gums reattach to teeth and eliminate gum pockets.
- Periodontal Maintenance Cleaning. Whereas prophylaxis dental cleaning is done as preventative care, periodontal maintenance takes care of existing problems with your oral health. They, therefore, need to be scheduled more frequently. Periodontal maintenance cleanings utilize scaling and root planing to remove plaque and tartar from teeth and gum pockets and to smooth out the tooth roots in order to treat existing gum disease.
- Gross Debridement Cleaning. Gross debridement cleanings are the most heavy-duty of teeth cleanings, designed to clean teeth covered with copious amounts of plaque and tartar. Patients who require gross debridement generally struggle to maintain their oral hygiene and often haven’t visited their dentist for a significant amount of time. Since tartar is especially hard, and an electrical tool is used to loosen tartar during gross debridement cleanings. Once the excess plaque and tartar have been removed, a prophylaxis cleaning is performed to further clean the teeth.

## What Are the Advantages and Disadvantages of Professional Teeth Cleaning?

There is virtually no downside to having your teeth professionally cleaned. Cleanings are as minimally invasive as dental treatments can be, requiring no numbing of the mouth and little time in the dentist’s chair. Regular (prophylaxis) teeth cleanings typically take 30-60 minutes to perform. Some patients may dislike the feel or taste of the gritty toothpaste used for the deep brushing phase or the taste of the fluoride treatment, but these phases each last just a few minutes.

There are significant advantages to having your teeth professionally cleaned on a regular basis:

- Plaque and tartar removal. Brushing and flossing at home can’t remove tartar.
- Preventing tooth decay. Tartar causes cavities and tooth decay, which require more invasive (and expensive) dentistry to repair.
- Preventing [gum disease](/services/complete-dentistry/gum-disease/). Professional cleanings keep gums healthy, preventing infections which would also require more advanced dental treatments.

## What Happens During a Teeth Cleaning?

Professional teeth cleanings typically follow these steps:

1. Physical Exam. Most teeth cleanings are performed by a dental hygienist. Before the cleaning process begins, they start with a dental exam, using a small mirror to check around your teeth and gums for any potential concerns.

2. Removal of plaque and tartar. The dental hygienist uses a scaler to get rid of plaque and tartar around your gum line, as well as between your teeth. The more tartar there is on your teeth, the more time your hygienist will need to scrape a particular spot.

3. Gritty toothpaste cleaning. The hygienist then brushes your teeth with a high-powered electric brush and gritty toothpaste. This is a great way to give your teeth a deep cleaning and remove any tartar left behind from the scaler.

4. Expert flossing. Whether you floss regularly at home or not, nothing beats an expert flossing session. Your dental hygienist can get deep between your teeth and locate any potential trouble spots where you might bleed at the gums.

5. Rinsing. Next, you’ll rinse out your mouth to get rid of any debris. Your dental hygienist may give you a rinse that contains liquid fluoride.

6. Applying fluoride treatment. The last step of the cleaning process is a fluoride treatment. This treatment is used as a protectant for your teeth to help fight against cavities for several months. Your dental hygienist will place a foamy gel or a sticky paste containing fluoride on your teeth for one minute. After removing the gel or paste, your [dentist](/about/) will inform you as to when you can next eat or drink (typically within 30 minutes.)

7. Other potential steps. X-rays are normally done once a year. Depending on what your dentist or dental hygienist observes in your mouth, they might do other exams during your visit.
