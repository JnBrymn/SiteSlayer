## OUR MISSION

## ARK Health Foundation(Formerly The Davis Focus Project)

Helping veterans heal from trauma and reach their highest potential through advanced human optimization programming, while simultaneously breaking barriers to care.

Listen to Veterans Voices

## Our Story

## the program

## Breaking Barriers With Science-Backed Programming​

The ARK Health Foundation is redefining veteran recovery by breaking down the barriers that prevent access to effective care. Through advanced human optimization programming, we provide veterans, service members, and Gold Star families with science-backed solutions that address the root causes of trauma, chronic stress, and performance deficits. By integrating cutting-edge diagnostics, non-verbal therapies, and personalized recovery strategies, we empower veterans to heal, rebuild resilience, and achieve their highest potential—without the stigma or limitations of traditional approaches.

## Barrier 1: Stigma Around Seeking Help

Veterans face undue stigma that keeps them from reaching their full potential. Instead of portraying mental health care as a weakness or labeling veterans as "broken," our approach redefines it as a powerful step toward personal excellence. We sharpen cognitive function, strengthen resilience, and boost overall well-being using strategies trusted by Tier 1 organizations, professional sports teams, and even NASA. Embracing help is a bold move—a testament to strength, determination, and unwavering perseverance—that proves true grit means continuously working to improve and optimize your life.

## Barrier 2: Fear of Reliving Trauma

Traditional approaches often require veterans to recount painful memories, triggering overwhelming stress responses. Our solution bypasses verbal recounting altogether. We employ nonverbal modalities that target the physiological imbalances created by trauma, allowing the brain and body to recalibrate naturally. This approach enables effective healing without dredging up painful experiences.

## Barrier 3: Overcoming Self-Blame (Attribution Theory)

Many veterans internalize their challenges as personal failings, but our approach is different. We use advanced diagnostics and lab testing to prove that these issues have a clear physiological basis. By presenting objective evidence that shows the problem is fixable, we shift the focus from self-blame to recovery. This evidence-based strategy empowers veterans to understand that their struggles are not inherent defects but conditions that can be corrected with targeted interventions.

Nick O’Kelly

Nick O’Kelly is originally from Western Washington, and now lives in Charlotte, NC. He attended Whitworth University in Spokane, WA prior to enlisting in the Army. Nick is married and has two beautiful children who are a daily blessing in his life. In his free time, he enjoys sports, being outdoors, working out, spending time with friends and family, and traveling.

Nick retired from the Army in 2023 as a Chief Warrant Officer 3. He initially entered the Army with a Special Forces enlisted contract and served as a Green Beret in 1st Special Forces Group (Airborne). He went on to attend flight school and became a Warrant Officer. After a short time flying in 3rd Combat Aviation Brigade, he assessed and was selected to become a Special Operations Blackhawk Pilot in the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne). He has multiple combat and non-combat deployments worldwide.

In his later years of service, Nick O'Kelly confronted personal challenges with mental health. Facing the widespread stigmas associated with seeking help, he experienced trepidation at the thought of jeopardizing his flight status and the esteem of his career. This concern kept him silent, attempting to navigate his difficulties in solitude, a path that proved to be strenuous and unfruitful. It wasn’t until a knee surgery necessitated a pause in his aviation duties that Nick had the opportunity to reevaluate his priorities. This interlude became a pivotal moment for introspection and acceptance of support, fundamentally altering his life’s direction.

Empowered by his recovery, Nick is now fervently dedicated to guiding both military and civilian members to recognize the strength in vulnerability. His mission is to foster a culture where reaching out for help is not only accepted but encouraged, illuminating the path of hope in the face of adversity. Nick advocates for the message that no individual should navigate the complexities of life's storms in solitude.
