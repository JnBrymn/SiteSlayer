SUBJECT: Help Veterans Get Answers Faster on the Ark Health Foundation Website

-----------------------------------------

Hi Brandon,

I’m truly inspired by Ark Health Foundation’s mission and the science-backed programs you offer for veterans. The depth of care and clarity your site provides is impressive—and I’d love to help make it even easier for veterans and families to find the information they need.

I’m Zac, founder of SlayDigital.ai. We build simple, custom AI chat agents that live right on your website, making it easy for visitors to get instant answers based on your existing content. It’s a straightforward way to reduce repetitive questions and help more people take confident next steps—with no extra complexity for your team.

I put together a demo using your site content: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/arkhealthfoundation_com. Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner and ask a question; the agent replies instantly using publicly available information from your website.

You can try asking things like:
- What types of therapies and diagnostics are used in your program?
- How can veterans or Gold Star families get started?
- When and where is the next Horsepower for Heroes event?
- Are there any costs involved for participants?
- How does your approach differ from traditional trauma recovery programs?

If this would help you serve more veterans—or simply make life easier for your team—I’d be happy to connect or answer any questions. No pressure at all.

Thank you for what you do,
Zac
