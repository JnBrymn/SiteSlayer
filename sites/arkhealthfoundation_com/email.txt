SUBJECT: Helping Veterans Explore Your Program—See a Demo for ARK Health Foundation

-----------------------------------------

Hi Brandon,

I’m genuinely inspired by the mission of ARK Health Foundation—your clear focus on breaking barriers to care and supporting veterans’ total wellness stands out.

I lead SlayDigital.ai, where we build simple, custom AI agents that live on your website and instantly answer visitor questions, using only your site’s content. This helps organizations like yours provide quick clarity without adding complexity.

I’ve set up a quick demo based on your own site: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/arkhealthfoundation_com. There’s a chat icon in the lower-right corner—just click to open it and ask anything you’d normally get via email or contact forms.

You can try asking things like:
- How does the ARK program help with PTSD or TBI?
- What advanced diagnostics and therapies do you offer?
- How can I get involved or support your mission?
- Are there real-life success stories from veterans?
- What steps are involved in joining the program?

Would love your feedback or thoughts—happy to answer any questions, or set this up for you if it’s useful.

Best,  
Zac
