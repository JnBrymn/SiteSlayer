SUBJECT: Helping Veterans Find Answers Faster on ARK Health Foundation

-----------------------------------------

Hi Brandon,

Your mission at ARK Health Foundation—breaking down barriers and redefining recovery for veterans—is incredibly inspiring. I’ve spent some time on your site, and I can see how much dedication has gone into making your science-backed programs accessible.

I lead SlayDigital.ai, where we build custom, AI-powered web chat agents that make it easier for visitors to get clear, immediate answers using only your existing site content. I put together a mock version of the ARK Health Foundation website so you can see this in action: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/arkhealthfoundation_com

You’ll notice a small chat icon in the bottom-right corner—clicking it opens a simple chat box where visitors can type questions and get answers right from your site.

You can try asking things like:
- What kinds of advanced diagnostics are provided in the program?
- How does your approach support veterans without requiring them to relive trauma?
- What upcoming events or ways to get involved are available?
- Where can I read success stories or testimonials from other veterans?
- How can someone get in touch or start the enrollment process?

If you ever feel your team is fielding repetitive questions or want visitors—veterans and supporters alike—to quickly find key information, this might make things a little easier (and free you up for the conversations that really matter).

If this feels useful, I’d be happy to chat or customize it further for you. Just let me know what you think—no rush.

Best,
Zac
