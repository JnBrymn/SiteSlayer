They follow up with you and go above and beyond to make sure that everything is perfect. They are simply the BEST!"</p><p class="testimonial_name">Genia O.</p><p>"Best dentist I've ever had! The entire staff is phenomenal and they truly care about every person that walks thru the door. I drive all the way from Clarksville just because of the care I'm given and the amazing work they do. This is coming from a girl who hated going to the dentist until I was referred to Dr. Pace Sr. I have the most beautiful smile now that gets so many compliments on a daily basis and that is the best compliment I can think of getting, ever."</p><p class="testimonial_name">Gloria V.</p><p aria-hidden="true">"Dr James Pace Jr is an outstanding dentist. The knowledge he has in regards to performing everything from a crown, root canal, fillings and cosmetic services is exceptional! It is very apparent he is committed to providing the highest level of patient care. He is professional, compassionate and constantly learning new technologies and the very latest in dentistry. I feel my smile is in perfect hands with Dr. James Pace Jr."</p><p aria-hidden="true" class="testimonial_name">Allie M.</p><p aria-hidden="true">"Dr. Pace Jr is so amazing I could seriously hug him! I came in fearful, anxious and in pain from a cracked tooth that not one but two prior dentists had missed. He was able to save my tooth with a crown and for the first time in over a year I can chew on it. Check them out!"</p><p aria-hidden="true" class="testimonial_name">Kelly M.</p><p aria-hidden="true">"Dr. Pace did an amazing job on filling my two front teeth today! It looks like I never had anything wrong with them. You want your Dentist to strive for perfection and it shows in his work he certainly does. Everyone who works in the office is nice and creates a happy, professional atmosphere when one comes in for their Dental needs. Thanks and happy to be a patient here!"</p><p aria-hidden="true" class="testimonial_name">Miser L.</p><p aria-hidden="true">"When I first moved to Nashville, it was difficult to find a dentist that I fully trusted. I found Belle Meade Family Dentistry many years ago. Dr. Pace Sr, was great. Always a pleasure and never made you feel unimportant. Never any issues. A Few years later he introduced me to his son, Dr James Pace, Jr. The rest is history. Dr Pace Jr. is by far the best dentist I have ever used. From general annual appointments to surgical, this man definitely has it down! He and his Medical Staff always go out of their way for their patients. I've been a patient of his since the time he went into practice with his Father. Best dental decision I ever made!  Look no further than Belle Meade Family Dentistry."</p><p aria-hidden="true" class="testimonial_name">Steve W.</p></section><section class="doctors bg-smoke" id="Doctors"><h2 class="h2 all-caps align-left">Meet the Doctors</h2><a aria-controls="w-tabs-0-data-w-pane-0" aria-selected="true" class="doctors-link_block w-inline-block w-tab-link w--current" data-w-tab="Tab 1" href="#w-tabs-0-data-w-pane-0" id="w-tabs-0-data-w-tab-0" role="tab">Dr. James R Pace Sr</a><a aria-controls="w-tabs-0-data-w-pane-1" aria-selected="false" class="doctors-link_block w-inline-block w-tab-link" data-w-tab="Tab 2" href="#w-tabs-0-data-w-pane-1" id="w-tabs-0-data-w-tab-1" role="tab" tabindex="-1">Dr. James R Pace Jr, FAGD</a><a aria-controls="w-tabs-0-data-w-pane-2" aria-selected="false" class="doctors-link_block w-inline-block w-tab-link" data-w-tab="Tab 3" href="#w-tabs-0-data-w-pane-2" id="w-tabs-0-data-w-tab-2" role="tab" tabindex="-1">Dr. Cole Reitnauer</a><p class="bold-text text_color-light_blue all-caps">Dr. James R Pace Sr</p><p>Dr. James R.
