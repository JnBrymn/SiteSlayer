SUBJECT: Helping New Patients at Belle Meade Family Dentistry Get Answers Faster

Hi there,

I’ve been impressed by how Belle Meade Family Dentistry emphasizes comfort, detail, and a welcoming experience for Nashville families. I noticed you offer a wide range of services and have lots of information available, which is great—but I imagine you get quite a few routine questions from new and existing patients.

I’m Zac Slay, founder of SlayDigital.ai. We build simple, custom AI chat agents that answer visitors’ questions directly from your website content—helping reduce repetitive calls and making it easier for patients to get the answers they need.

I set up a quick demo using a copy of your website: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_bellemeadedental_com.  
Just click the chat icon at the bottom-right and type a question—the agent will answer with info pulled directly from your site.

You can try asking things like:
- “What dental services do you offer?”
- “How do I schedule an appointment?”
- “What sedation options are available if I have dental anxiety?”
- “Who are the dentists and what are their backgrounds?”
- “How does payment work and do you accept online payments?”

If you think this could make things simpler for your team and your patients, I’d love to hear your thoughts or set up a quick call to discuss.

Best,  
Zac Slay
