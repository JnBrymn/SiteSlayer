## Replace missing teeth with long-lasting, natural-looking solutions

Missing one or more teeth? Dental implants restore the look, feel, and function of your smile with long-term reliability. At Belle Meade Family Dentistry, we provide full-scope **dental implant solutions in Nashville**, from single-tooth replacements to full-arch restorations like All-on-4.

Whether youâre struggling to chew, hiding your smile, or tired of loose dentures, our implant dentistry options offer a secure, life-changing upgrade.

## **What are dental implants?**

Dental implants are small titanium posts placed in the jawbone to support a crown, bridge, or denture. Once healed, they function like a natural tooth root â stable, strong, and long-lasting.

Each implant consists of three parts:

- **Implant post:** Surgically placed into the jawbone
- **Abutment:** Connects the post to the visible restoration
- **Crown, bridge, or denture:** The visible tooth or teeth replacement

## **Benefits of implants over bridges or dentures**

- Permanent solution â no slipping or adhesives
- Preserves bone and facial structure
- Restores chewing power
- Looks and feels like your real teeth

Easy to care for with brushing and flossing

"Dr. Pace Jr is so amazing I could seriously hug him! I came in fearful, anxious and in pain from a cracked tooth that not one but two prior dentists had missed. He was able to save my tooth with a crown and for the first time in over a year I can chew on it. Check them out!"
