head><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;500;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet" /></head>

"Dr. James Pace Jr. is the best dentist that I have ever worked with! I have several front teeth that have crowns and one front tooth required an implant during the past months. Dr. Pace and his staff were awesome, patient and kind. They follow up with you and go above and beyond to make sure that everything is perfect. They are simply the BEST!"

Genia O.

"Best dentist I've ever had! The entire staff is phenomenal and they truly care about every person that walks thru the door. I drive all the way from Clarksville just because of the care I'm given and the amazing work they do. This is coming from a girl who hated going to the dentist until I was referred to Dr. Pace Sr. I have the most beautiful smile now that gets so many compliments on a daily basis and that is the best compliment I can think of getting, ever."

Gloria V.

"Dr James Pace Jr is an outstanding dentist. The knowledge he has in regards to performing everything from a crown, root canal, fillings and cosmetic services is exceptional! It is very apparent he is committed to providing the highest level of patient care. He is professional, compassionate and constantly learning new technologies and the very latest in dentistry. I feel my smile is in perfect hands with Dr. James Pace Jr."

Allie M.

"Dr. Pace Jr is so amazing I could seriously hug him! I came in fearful, anxious and in pain from a cracked tooth that not one but two prior dentists had missed. He was able to save my tooth with a crown and for the first time in over a year I can chew on it. Check them out!"

Kelly M.

"Dr. Pace did an amazing job on filling my two front teeth today! It looks like I never had anything wrong with them. You want your Dentist to strive for perfection and it shows in his work he certainly does. Everyone who works in the office is nice and creates a happy, professional atmosphere when one comes in for their Dental needs. Thanks and happy to be a patient here!"

Miser L.

"When I first moved to Nashville, it was difficult to find a dentist that I fully trusted. I found Belle Meade Family Dentistry many years ago. Dr. Pace Sr, was great. Always a pleasure and never made you feel unimportant. Never any issues. A Few years later he introduced me to his son, Dr James Pace, Jr. The rest is history. Dr Pace Jr. is by far the best dentist I have ever used. From general annual appointments to surgical, this man definitely has it down! He and his Medical Staff always go out of their way for their patients. I've been a patient of his since the time he went into practice with his Father. Best dental decision I ever made!  Look no further than Belle Meade Family Dentistry."

# Learn More About Our Practice

We'd like to invite you to explore what makes our practice unique and special.

## ABOUT US

Having provided care in the Nashville area for over thirty-five years, we understand our awesome responsibility to the patients under our care. Our dental team works tirelessly to maintain your trust in order to provide you the highest level of general, cosmetic, and reconstructive dental care that you deserve. Our philosophy of practice entails a number of core values that our staff and doctors are committed to upholding.

### Comprehensive Care

Knowing we must work hard to continually deserve your trust, we are devoted to working our hardest every day. Dentistry is a dynamic and ever-changing profession that requires willingness to change in order to provide “state of the art” patient care. Consistent evaluation of technology allows us to provide the advancements that most benefit our patients. Cutting edge technology and techniques help us to not only provide quicker diagnosis with faster, less invasive treatments but also ensure the best in patient treatment outcomes. Belle Meade Family Dentistry is a comprehensive dental practice where treatment options are tailored to meet the individual concerns of each patient with a goal of reaching and maintaining great oral health. Our comprehensive approach allows us to take into consideration both the functional and esthetic aspects of a patient’s teeth. Our philosophy provides the opportunity to look at the long term dental picture and reach a plan that will keep a patient’s teeth healthy long into the future. We believe that the foundation and beginning for good dental health begins with healthy gums, allowing for other dental care to be performed but also providing decreased inflammation which positively impacts one’s overall systemic health. This important connection between overall health and its relation to healthy gums is an important priority in our office. Periodic dental x-rays and twice yearly exams and cleanings minimize the likelihood of advanced dental infection of the teeth, gums, and bone. The replacement of missing teeth or the restoring of broken or decayed teeth allows one to optimize tooth comfort, function, and appearance.

### Patient Rights and Comfort

We know that the foundation for building better dental health is built upon mutual trust, communication, and understanding. It is our belief that after being provided with all treatment options, risks, benefits, and consequences of no treatment, the patient has the right to chose what is best for them. Our hope is that we throughly educate and inform you of your dental health in a comfortable, clean, prompt, stress free environment. We pay attention to each patient’s needs and desires and offer sympathetic care that recognizes the fears many patients have about coming to the dentist.

Belle Meade Family Dentistry is proud of our community and the role we play in providing healthcare to those in and around Nashville. Our comprehensive approach can successfully blend the art and science of dentistry with the realities of your lifestyle, health concerns, and budget. From all of us at Belle Meade Family Dentistry, we invite you to come see for yourself the difference in the way you will be cared for. As a member of our practice family, you will find a welcoming team with many long-term employees and professionals who provide stability to the practice philosophy. Listening to you and understanding your needs is our number one job.

### Belle Meade Family Dentistry Mission Statement

- We seek to provide the finest quality dental care for our patients in a warm, caring, and clean environment.

Still unsure? Schedule a consultation and let our team create a custom plan that fits your smile goals.

## What Type of Veneers are Available?

### ‍Porcelain Veneers

Porcelain veneers are durable, and are made out of ceramic. These veneers can be matched exactly to the shade of your natural teeth. Porcelain veneers are the most common type of veneer used because of the ability to really customize the veneer to best fit your teeth. Porcelain veneers preserve as much of your existing tooth as possible, and give patients a long lasting smile.

### Lumineers

Lumineers are another type of porcelain veneer that can help to improve a patient’s smile. This type of veneer requires minimal tooth preparation, and the material is thinner and easily applied compared to traditional porcelain veneers. Placement of Lumineers can be done without injections or anesthesia, and give patients the same benefits and long lasting results.

### Composite Resin

Composite resin veneers give the same results and benefits compared to traditional porcelain veneers. This type of veneer helps with chips, teeth length, and gaps between teeth. Composite resin veneers are less expensive, making this a budget friendly choice for patients. The life of a composite resin veneer is not as long as traditional porcelain veneers. Composite resin veneers are applied in a similar fashion with minimal tooth preparation.

### Zirconia

Zirconia veneers are typically used for patients that have severely decayed or damaged teeth. This type of veneer is helpful for patients that are looking for an option that is stronger than porcelain veneers. Zirconia is typically used for back teeth, and this type of material can add strength to teeth to prevent wear and tear.

# Dental Implants in Nashville, TN

## Replace missing teeth with long-lasting, natural-looking solutions

Missing one or more teeth? Dental implants restore the look, feel, and function of your smile with long-term reliability. At Belle Meade Family Dentistry, we provide full-scope dental implant solutions in Nashville, from single-tooth replacements to full-arch restorations like All-on-4.

Whether you’re struggling to chew, hiding your smile, or tired of loose dentures, our implant dentistry options offer a secure, life-changing upgrade.

## What are dental implants?

Dental implants are small titanium posts placed in the jawbone to support a crown, bridge, or denture. Once healed, they function like a natural tooth root — stable, strong, and long-lasting.

Each implant consists of three parts:

- Implant post: Surgically placed into the jawbone
- Abutment: Connects the post to the visible restoration
- Crown, bridge, or denture: The visible tooth or teeth replacement

## Benefits of implants over bridges or dentures

- Permanent solution — no slipping or adhesives
- Preserves bone and facial structure
- Restores chewing power
- Looks and feels like your real teeth

Easy to care for with brushing and flossing

## Our Implant Services

We provide a full range of implant options for patients across Nashville, Belle Meade, and surrounding areas:

### ● Single Tooth Implants

Perfect for replacing a single missing tooth without altering neighboring teeth.

### ● Implant Restorations

Have an existing implant that needs a new crown or repair? We restore damaged or outdated restorations placed elsewhere.

[Explore implant restorations →](https://www.bellemeadedental.com/implant-dentistry/dental-implant-restoration)

### ● All-on-4 Implant Dentures

Replace a full arch of teeth with just four implants. A stable, fixed alternative to traditional dentures that restores aesthetics and function.

### ● Implant-Supported Removable Dentures

A hybrid option that snaps into place using dental implants for added security — no more slipping.

### ● Bone Grafting

Low bone density? We offer bone grafting to rebuild jaw structure and prepare for future implants.

[See our bone grafting services →](https://www.bellemeadedental.com/implant-dentistry/bone-grafting)

## Who is a candidate?

You may be a candidate for dental implants if you:

- Are missing one or more teeth
- Have good oral health and stable bone structure
- Are looking for a permanent, non-removable solution
- Don’t want to deal with the downsides of traditional dentures

We'll assess your oral health and use 3D CT scanning to plan your case accurately.

## Sedation options for comfort

Implant placement is a routine surgical procedure. For added comfort, we offer [oral sedation](https://www.bellemeadedental.com/services/general-dentistry/sedation-dentistry), especially helpful for anxious patients or more complex treatments like All-on-4.

## Cost and financing

Implants are an investment — but the results are worth it. The cost depends on the number of implants, type of restoration, and whether bone grafting is needed. We’ll provide a clear breakdown of treatment options and costs upfront.

Need help budgeting? Visit our [Patient Info page](https://www.bellemeadedental.com/patient-info) to learn more about flexible financing options.

## What to expect: Timeline & Healing

The full dental implant process typically involves:

1. Consultation & Imaging
2. Implant Placement
3. Healing Period (3–6 months)
4. Final Restoration (crown, denture, or bridge)

Some patients may qualify for immediate-load options like same-day implant dentures. We’ll walk you through your timeline during your consult.

## Why choose Belle Meade Family Dentistry?

- Decades of experience with implant procedures

- Advanced 3D CT scanning for precise planning

## FAQs

How long do dental implants last?With proper care, implants can last decades — many for life. The restoration may need replacing over time, but the implant post itself is highly durable.

Are dental implants painful?Placement is done under local anesthesia and can be combined with oral sedation. Post-op discomfort is typically manageable with medication and resolves in a few days.

Can I get an implant if I’ve had dentures for years?Possibly. We’ll check your bone density and may recommend bone grafting before implant placement if there’s bone loss.

How do I care for my implants?Treat them like natural teeth — brush, floss, and visit us for regular checkups and cleanings.
