"Dr. James Pace Jr. is the best dentist that I have ever worked with! I have several front teeth that have crowns and one front tooth required an implant during the past months. Dr. Pace and his staff were awesome, patient and kind. They follow up with you and go above and beyond to make sure that everything is perfect. They are simply the BEST!"

Genia O.

“

"Best dentist I've ever had! The entire staff is phenomenal and they truly care about every person that walks thru the door. I drive all the way from Clarksville just because of the care I'm given and the amazing work they do. This is coming from a girl who hated going to the dentist until I was referred to Dr. Pace Sr. I have the most beautiful smile now that gets so many compliments on a daily basis and that is the best compliment I can think of getting, ever."

Gloria V.

“

"Dr James Pace Jr is an outstanding dentist. The knowledge he has in regards to performing everything from a crown, root canal, fillings and cosmetic services is exceptional! It is very apparent he is committed to providing the highest level of patient care. He is professional, compassionate and constantly learning new technologies and the very latest in dentistry. I feel my smile is in perfect hands with Dr. James Pace Jr."

Allie M.

“

"Dr. Pace Jr is so amazing I could seriously hug him! I came in fearful, anxious and in pain from a cracked tooth that not one but two prior dentists had missed. He was able to save my tooth with a crown and for the first time in over a year I can chew on it. Check them out!"

Kelly M.

“

"Dr. Pace did an amazing job on filling my two front teeth today! It looks like I never had anything wrong with them. You want your Dentist to strive for perfection and it shows in his work he certainly does. Everyone who works in the office is nice and creates a happy, professional atmosphere when one comes in for their Dental needs. Thanks and happy to be a patient here!"

Miser L.

“

"When I first moved to Nashville, it was difficult to find a dentist that I fully trusted. I found Belle Meade Family Dentistry many years ago. Dr. Pace Sr, was great. Always a pleasure and never made you feel unimportant. Never any issues. A Few years later he introduced me to his son, Dr James Pace, Jr. The rest is history. Dr Pace Jr. is by far the best dentist I have ever used. From general annual appointments to surgical, this man definitely has it down! He and his Medical Staff always go out of their way for their patients. I've been a patient of his since the time he went into practice with his Father. Best dental decision I ever made!  Look no further than Belle Meade Family Dentistry."

Steve W.

## Replace missing teeth with long-lasting, natural-looking solutions

Missing one or more teeth? Dental implants restore the look, feel, and function of your smile with long-term reliability. At Belle Meade Family Dentistry, we provide full-scope **dental implant solutions in Nashville**, from single-tooth replacements to full-arch restorations like All-on-4.

Whether you’re struggling to chew, hiding your smile, or tired of loose dentures, our implant dentistry options offer a secure, life-changing upgrade.

## **What are dental implants?**

Dental implants are small titanium posts placed in the jawbone to support a crown, bridge, or denture. Once healed, they function like a natural tooth root — stable, strong, and long-lasting.

Each implant consists of three parts:

- **Implant post:** Surgically placed into the jawbone
- **Abutment:** Connects the post to the visible restoration
- **Crown, bridge, or denture:** The visible tooth or teeth replacement

## **Benefits of implants over bridges or dentures**

- Permanent solution — no slipping or adhesives
- Preserves bone and facial structure
- Restores chewing power
- Looks and feels like your real teeth

Easy to care for with brushing and flossing

![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/w4a_8uB_glQ/sddefault.jpg)

## Our Implant Services

We provide a full range of implant options for patients across Nashville, Belle Meade, and surrounding areas:

### **● Single Tooth Implants**

Perfect for replacing a single missing tooth without altering neighboring teeth.

### **● Implant Restorations**

Have an existing implant that needs a new crown or repair? We restore damaged or outdated restorations placed elsewhere.

[Explore implant restorations →](https://www.bellemeadedental.com/implant-dentistry/dental-implant-restoration)

### **● All-on-4 Implant Dentures**

Replace a full arch of teeth with just four implants. A stable, fixed alternative to traditional dentures that restores aesthetics and function.

[Learn more about All-on-4 →](https://www.bellemeadedental.com/implant-dentistry/all-on-4)

### **● Implant-Supported Removable Dentures**

A hybrid option that snaps into place using dental implants for added security — no more slipping.

### **● Bone Grafting**

Low bone density? We offer bone grafting to rebuild jaw structure and prepare for future implants.

[See our bone grafting services →](https://www.bellemeadedental.com/implant-dentistry/bone-grafting)

## **Who is a candidate?**

You may be a candidate for dental implants if you:

- Are missing one or more teeth
- Have good oral health and stable bone structure
- Are looking for a permanent, non-removable solution
- Don’t want to deal with the downsides of traditional dentures

We'll assess your oral health and use 3D CT scanning to plan your case accurately.

![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/oaBocweDXvU/sddefault.jpg)

## Sedation options for comfort

Implant placement is a routine surgical procedure. For added comfort, we offer [oral sedation](https://www.bellemeadedental.com/services/general-dentistry/sedation-dentistry), especially helpful for anxious patients or more complex treatments like All-on-4.

## **Cost and financing**

Implants are an investment — but the results are worth it. The cost depends on the number of implants, type of restoration, and whether bone grafting is needed. We’ll provide a clear breakdown of treatment options and costs upfront.

Need help budgeting? Visit our [Patient Info page](https://www.bellemeadedental.com/patient-info) to learn more about flexible financing options.

## **What to expect: Timeline & Healing**

The full dental implant process typically involves:

1. **Consultation & Imaging**
2. **Implant Placement**
3. **Healing Period (3–6 months)**
4. **Final Restoration (crown, denture, or bridge)**

Some patients may qualify for immediate-load options like same-day implant dentures. We’ll walk you through your timeline during your consult.

## **Why choose Belle Meade Family Dentistry?**

## FAQs

**How long do dental implants last?**With proper care, implants can last decades — many for life. The restoration may need replacing over time, but the implant post itself is highly durable.

**Can I get an implant if I’ve had dentures for years?**Possibly. We’ll check your bone density and may recommend bone grafting before implant placement if there’s bone loss.

**How do I care for my implants?**Treat them like natural teeth — brush, floss, and visit us for regular checkups and cleanings.

## What is Restorative Dentistry?

Restorative dentistry involves treatments and procedures that improve the function and aesthetic value of your smile. Restorative dentistry can range from procedures that improve the way that you chew and eat to cosmetic options that enhance the look and feel of your teeth. At Riverwalk Dental Group, we offer a range of quality restorative procedures to fit your needs. With the help of an examination done by our doctors, we can create a specialized treatment plan just for you.

## Why is Restorative Dentistry needed?

You may need restorative dentistry if you have teeth that have become compromised in some way. You might be dealing with tooth decay, lost restorations, broken teeth or are simply interested in whitening, bonding or veneers. Our goal is to offer you a wide variety of restorative options that aim to improve the health and look of your smile. Restorative options vary from one patient to another, ensuring that you receive only what is needed.

## What makes you a candidate for Restorative Dentistry?

Prior to having any type of restorative procedure done, you'll come into our office for a consultation. The consult will include an exam and series of different x-rays so that we can create a personalized treatment plan just for you. We will help in teaching you about each individual procedure and what to expect when having it done.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/635fb83feadb6eb86c5ff1c0/643a8bf41aba3a84b35726f1_AdobeStock_13845821.webp)

## What can be expected with Restorative Dentistry?

Because there are so many different restoration options available, you will need to consult with our doctors prior to having work done. What works for one patient may not be right for you, so it is important that you understand your options. The purpose of restorative dentistry is to correct certain problems while simultaneously improving the look of your teeth. Some of the most common restorative procedures include:

- Fixed bridges
- Dental crowns
- Bonding
- Veneers
- Fillings
- Amalgam filling replacement
- Root canals
- Extractions
- Inlays and onlays
- Implants

If you're in need of restorative dentistry and want to know more about your treatment options, [contact us today](/contact) and our helpful staff members can assist you.
