SUBJECT: A Simple Way to Answer Your Patients’ Top Questions—Instantly

Hi Dr. Murfree and the Murfree Dental team,

I’m Zac Slay, founder of SlayDigital.ai, and I wanted to share something that could make life a little easier for your team—and more welcoming for your patients.

We build simple, custom AI chat agents that use the content already on your website to instantly answer visitor questions, right from your site. No technical jargon, just practical help for new and returning patients alike.

To see how this works, here’s a personalized demo based on your website: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_murfreedental_com. Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner and type a question—your virtual agent will answer using information from your site.

You can try asking things like:
- Are you accepting new patients?  
- What financial options or in-house plans do you offer?  
- How do I schedule an appointment or fill out forms?  
- What dental technology do you use?  
- Do you provide sedation or emergency dental care?

It’s a quick way to cut down on phone calls and make sure your patients always feel informed and supported. If you’d like to talk about making this part of your real website, just let me know—no pressure.

Wishing you and your staff a wonderful week,

Zac Slay  
Founder, SlayDigital.ai
