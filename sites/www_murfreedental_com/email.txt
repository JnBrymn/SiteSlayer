SUBJECT: Helping New Patients Get Answers Fast on Murfree Dental’s Website

-----------------------------------------
Hi Dr. Murfree,

I enjoyed seeing how Murfree Dental combines advanced technology with such a warm, welcoming approach for families in Murfreesboro. Your team’s commitment to clear patient communication really stood out.

I’m Zac from SlayDigital.ai. We help practices like yours make it even easier for patients to get answers by adding a simple, friendly AI web agent directly to your site—no jargon, just useful help based on your own content.

I put together a quick demo using a mock version of your website: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_murfreedental_com. Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner and type a question; the agent responds instantly using details already on your site.

You can try asking things like:
- What dental insurance or payment plans do you accept?
- How do I schedule a first appointment, and what forms do I need?
- Do you offer sedation options for patients with dental anxiety?
- What is your process for dental implants or Invisalign?
- What should I do if I need emergency dental care outside of office hours?

I’d be glad to hear any feedback and answer questions if you’re interested in making website communication even easier for your patients—no pressure at all.

Warm regards,  
Zac
