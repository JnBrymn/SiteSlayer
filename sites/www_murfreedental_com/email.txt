Hi Dr. Murfree,

I was impressed by how Murfree Dental blends advanced technology with a personalized, friendly approach. Your “family-based” focus and thorough explanations set you apart.

I’m Zac from SlayDigital.ai. We help practices like yours make website information even easier for patients with custom AI chat agents—simple, helpful tools that answer questions using your own site’s content, right on your website.

I made a quick demo with your content here: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_murfreedental_com — you’ll see a chat icon in the lower right corner. Clicking it opens a box where you can type any question, and it replies based on details already on your site.

For example, you can try asking things like:
- “What insurance plans do you accept or what financial options are available?”
- “How do I request an appointment or fill out new patient forms?”
- “What sedation options do you offer for anxious patients?”
- “Do you offer dental implants or Invisalign, and how do I know if I qualify?”
- “What are your office hours and which days are you open?”

Our approach is all about clarity—answering the repeat questions fast, helping new and nervous patients feel more at home, and freeing your team to focus on care.

Would you be open to a quick call to see if this could save your team time or improve your patients’ online experience?

Warm regards,  
Zac
