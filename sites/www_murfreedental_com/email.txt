Hi Dr. Murfree,

I came across Murfree Dental’s site and was impressed by how clearly you communicate services—from Invisalign to laser dentistry—and the warm sense of welcome you provide to new patients in Murfreesboro.

I’m Zac, founder of SlayDigital.ai. We build simple, custom AI chat agents that sit right on your website, helping visitors quickly find answers from your existing content—without more calls or searching.

To show what this could look like for your practice, I’ve set up a quick demo using a mock version of your site:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_murfreedental_com

Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner and ask a question; the agent responds using only information from your website.

You can try asking things like:
- What insurance and payment options do you accept?
- How do I schedule a new patient appointment?
- What should I expect during my first visit?
- Do you offer sedation or emergency dental care?
- Can I see examples of patient smile transformations?

If you think this could save your team time or help patients get what they need faster, I’d love to hear your thoughts—no pressure.

Best,  
Zac
