SUBJECT: A simple way to welcome visitors (and questions) for your next launch

Hi hello team,

I love your message on the site—turning a pause into a promise for “something even better” is a great way to keep your community engaged.

I’m Zac from SlayDigital.ai. We build simple AI chat agents that live on your site and help visitors get instant answers from your own content—even if your team is busy or heads-down building the next version.

I set up a quick mock version of your site here: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_hello_com. There’s a chat icon in the bottom-right; just click it to open the chat and try asking questions—the agent responds using info already on your site.

You can try things like:
- When will the new hello launch?
- Can I sign up for updates?
- Where can I find past community news?
- Is hello available in other languages?
- Who’s behind the hello team?

If you’d like something like this handy for your next announcement or re-launch, I’d be happy to chat. No pressure—just wanted to show a quick demo.

Best,  
Zac
