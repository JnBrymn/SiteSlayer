SUBJECT: Try out a simple AI chat agent for your upcoming launch

-----------------------------------------
Hi hello team,

I saw your update about pausing hello while you prepare for your next big launch—exciting times ahead! I appreciate how you’ve fostered such a warm community.

I wanted to share a quick way to make your upcoming site even more welcoming for returning visitors. At SlayDigital.ai, we build simple, custom AI chat agents that let site visitors get instant answers based on your own content—without any technical hassle.

To give you a feel, I set up a demo using your current page: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_hello_com  
Just click the chat icon at the bottom-right to open a chat box and ask questions—your community can get info right from your site.

You can try asking things like:
- When will hello relaunch?
- How can I get notified about the new launch?
- Will my old account or data carry over?
- Is hello available in other languages?
- Can I still contact the hello team during the pause?

If you’re curious how this could help make your new launch even smoother, I’d love to chat. No rush—just let me know if you’d like to see more.

Wishing you all the best with what’s next,
Zac
