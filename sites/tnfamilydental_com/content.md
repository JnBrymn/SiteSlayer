## Reviews from our 4 Convenient Locations

- As a client of Tennessee Family Dental of Lebanon, I would recommend them to anyone moving in the area or who just would like to change dentist offices. They take excellent care of me and my family and are the best around town.

Stephanie Bentley,
- I walked into to TN Family dental and was blown away by the friendly staff and spotless facility. I had wanted to get caught up on some things. I had four and half hours of procedure done at once. Never felt a needle and never felt discomfort. You can tell when people like each other. You can tell when a staff is happy. It reflects in the work they do and the over all feel of the experience. This office is a team and I am so thankful I found them. I had a crown and veneer done with two silver fillings replaced and a cavity filled. I am more than pleased with skills of my doctor and the r...

Tim A.,

- Yesterday when my filling broke I called Tennessee family dental and they got me in the same day and at a time that worked well for me! From the moment I walked in everyone was so friendly which immediately put me at ease! [The Dr.] and his assistants made me feel like their top priority ! [He] clearly explained the crown procedure and would continuously check in on me during the procedure to make sure I was comfortable. I left feeling so happy with my final treatment and overall experience.

Emily H.,
- My sleep apnea doctor recommended I visit Dr. Farringer for a dental appliance that would remove the need for me to wear my CPAP device. What a life saver! I now sleep better without a mask attached to my face and can now travel easily without lugging around my CPAP machine and distilled water. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable.

S.P. – Smyrna, TN,

- Warm and efficient staff serve two extremely perfectionistic dentists. We have both had crown work with Dr. O'Neill and were impressed…Jan and Christy are excellent, caring hygienists. This is the answer to your dental needs.

Jean Johnson,
- I usually don't write reviews but had to let everyone know about my experience today. I hate and I mean hate the dentist and don't ever go but had some issues come up and needed to go. I found out about Tennessee Family Dental through a friend of mine and decided to give them a try. As I entered the door I was welcomed with many smiling faces and the front desk lady was very polite. They could tell I was nervous and reassured me everything was going to be okay. The girl called me back to the chair and explained exactly what they were going to do today. She asked if I had any questions an...

Sara Norton Andre,

- I had a big cavity that was causing me a bad pain. I asked if I can do a filling for it the same day that I had my six months cleaning and the doctor was very quick and agreed to work on it the same day. I got my cleaning and my filling done in no time. The staff is very friendly and caring, they made me feel very welcomed and happy. I really recommend them!!!

Miriam Gergis,
- I'm currently in Nashville for work and when I first arrived, I was in so much pain. I couldn't eat, sleep, or do my job properly. I chose TN Family Dental based on their reviews and I am so glad I did. They scheduled me in immediately, worked with my schedule, and made sure I was comfortable and pain free the entire time. If I lived in the area, I would make TN Family Dental my dentist office. They truly care about their patients and this is by far the best dental office I have ever been to.

Yvette Rojo,

- Recently moved to Nashville and lucked out with Tennessee Family Dental. The La Vergne office is closest to me and Dr. Hill is a great dentist! I have some anxiety about going to the dentist, but Dr. Hill and Theresa were patient, gentle, and made me feel as comfortable as possible. They do a really great, professional job! Highly recommend.

Lorin Santo,
- This is one of four dental offices in middle TN and they are great. The staff is always friendly and helpful and I love my dental hygienist, Jan. I highly recommend this dental office.

Donna M.,


We love our patients and want each one to have a five-star dental experience at every single visit!

## FAQs about Our Practice

How many locations does Tennessee Family Dental have?

Tennessee Family Dental has 4 locations: [Brentwood](https://tnfamilydental.com/locations/brentwood/), [Green Hills](https://tnfamilydental.com/locations/green-hills/), [Lebanon](https://tnfamilydental.com/locations/lebanon/) & [La Vergne](https://tnfamilydental.com/locations/la-vergne/).

What if I do not have dental insurance?

[Dental insurance](https://tnfamilydental.com/insurance/) is one of many ways to pay for dental treatment, but it is not the only way. Many of our patients pay for their treatment with card, cash or check. In addition, our [In-Office Benefits Plan](https://tnfamilydental.com/insurance/#in-office-benefits-plan) is a very popular alternative to traditional dental insurance.

What insurances do you accept?

Our doctors are [in-network PPO providers](https://tnfamilydental.com/insurance/) for most major dental insurance plans. If we are not in-network with your dental insurance, we will file on your behalf as a courtesy. Unfortunately, we are not HMO providers at the moment, but we are in network with TennCare at our Brentwood, La Vergne and Lebanon locations.

Can I schedule an appointment online?

Currently we are unable to accept appointment requests online. Please contact us [here](https://tnfamilydental.com/contact/).

Tennessee Family Dental makes going to the dentist easy, convenient and stress-free.

# Four Locations. One Goal. Patient Comfort.

3D Digital Dentistry - Tennessee Family Dental, Nashville TN Dentist


Our dentists utilize 3D technology to visualize your teeth.

# 3D Digital Dentistry

## 3D dentistry. Better diagnosis. Better dentistry.

3D digital dentistry is an all-encompassing term used to describe the branch of dentistry that visualizes all three dimensions of the teeth and surrounding structures. In the past, 2D imaging was the only option, often resulting in misdiagnosis due to missing information.

## About 3D Digital Dentistry

The dentists at Tennessee Family Dental have several 3D imaging systems on site that allow us to provide a more accurate diagnosis and better quality dentistry on a consistent basis. Step into a world that uses 3D imaging and cutting-edge technology to visualize your teeth, jaw bone, and surrounding structures.

## 3D Cone Beam CT imaging

Cone Beam CT (or CBCT—Cone Beam Computed Tomography) is a [medical imaging technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging_technique) used by our dentists on a daily basis in treatment planning and diagnosis. CBCT allows us to plan the step-by-step process in [implant dentistry](https://tnfamilydental.com/service/implant-dentistry/), navigate difficult [root canals](https://tnfamilydental.com/service/root-canal-therapy/), visualized impacted [wisdom teeth](https://tnfamilydental.com/service/wisdom-teeth-removal/), screen patients who are high risk for [sleep apnea](https://tnfamilydental.com/service/snoring-sleep-apnea/), and identify causes of [TMJ pain](https://tnfamilydental.com/service/tmj-migraines-headaches/). We have CBCT technology at our [Brentwood](https://tnfamilydental.com/locations/brentwood/), [Green Hills](https://tnfamilydental.com/locations/green-hills/), and [Lebanon](https://tnfamilydental.com/locations/lebanon/) offices because we believe that our patients deserve the best.

## 3D Airway Analysis

Sleep apnea screening can be performed using CBCT by visualizing the anatomy of the upper airway. This 3D airway analysis highlights areas of narrowing that may contribute to sleep apnea. Our dentists are able to use this screening process to identify patients who are high risk for sleep apnea due to the anatomy of their airway. A sleep apnea test is then ordered for high risk patients to determine if the patient suffers from sleep apnea. Many of our patients claim that this 3D airway analysis screening process helped “save their life,” as it was the first step in receiving treatment for this potentially fatal condition.

## CEREC Digital Impressions

Improved accuracy and better fitting dental restorations are made possible with digital impressions. Our dentists at [Green Hills](https://tnfamilydental.com/locations/green-hills/) and [Lebanon](https://tnfamilydental.com/locations/lebanon/) utilize CEREC digital impression cutting-edge technology to create a virtual model of the teeth and surrounding tissue. This 3D digital technology captures highly accurate impression data without the need for traditional impressions, which can be inconvenient, time-consuming, and messy. The impression data is sent to our in-house dental lab, [Deuce-One Dental Lab](http://21dentallab.com/), that will begin making your custom crown under the guidance and supervision of your Tennessee Family Dental dentist. The dentist is able to evaluate the design of the crown before it is finalized and has the ability to see exactly what the crown will look like on the tooth – in 3D! Experience digital dental impressions. Experience the future of dentistry.

## How we can help

Tennessee Family Dental believes in using 3D imaging systems that allow our dentists to provide you with a better overall patient experience. Our leading-edge technology can help our dentists diagnose your dental condition more accurately leaving you confident in your treatment decision.

## About Cosmetic Dentistry

Selecting a qualified cosmetic dentist to transform your smile can be quite the challenge. There are several considerations to be aware of when making your decision, including cost, technique, and treatment philosophy.

### Cost

We pride ourselves as being one of the top dental offices in Nashville, Tennessee, in terms of affordability and quality. Our dentists deliver consistent cosmetic dentistry results at an affordable price. We understand that no one likes financial surprises at the end of treatment, and we avoid this by giving our patients a detailed cost breakdown at their initial consultation. We even offer [third-party financing options](https://tnfamilydental.com/insurance/#carecredit).

### Technique

Transforming smiles is no easy business. We have invested in leading-edge technology, allowing us to deliver the highest standard of care for our patients. Our technique involves a detailed, comprehensive evaluation at your initial visit, during which we discuss your primary concerns. You talk, we listen. In this initial consultation, we utilize [3D digital dentistry technology](https://tnfamilydental.com/service/3d-digital-dentistry/), giving you the most accurate treatment plan for your cosmetic procedure. After the initial consultation, we begin treatment with your primary concerns in mind, and we are finished only when you are completely satisfied with your new smile.

### Treatment Philosophy

Before you commit to a dentist to perform your cosmetic dental procedure, you should request a “sneak peak” at the final product. With our Smile Design Software, patients can see the end product before we begin treatment. Careful treatment planning and effective communication with our patients allows our dentists to deliver predictable, aesthetic results. Our philosophy is “start with the end in mind.”

Call your local Tennessee Family Dental office to find out how you can preview your treatment for [clear braces](https://tnfamilydental.com/service/invisalign/), [veneers](https://tnfamilydental.com/service/cosmetic-dentistry/veneers/), [smile makeover](https://tnfamilydental.com/service/cosmetic-dentistry/smile-makeover/), and even [guided dental implants](https://tnfamilydental.com/service/implant-dentistry/).

Tips for Insurance

Depending on your insurance plan, different procedures are paid differently by the insurance company. We recommend that you call your insurance carrier or your benefits office to determine your liability/out of pocket financial responsibility.

Many people are unaware of the benefits their dental or medical plans provide them annually, and despite paying their premiums in full they lose out on the covered care that is available under their plan! We don’t want that to happen to you!

As a courtesy, we will call your dental benefit carrier to obtain an explanation of benefits for your policy. Our patient coordinator will then help you interpret how to maximize your specific benefit plan. We accept and will file your claims, as a courtesy for you, to all major dental benefit carriers.

We have published a general guide written by Dr. Matthew T. Ertl to help you understand your dental insurance. While every dental benefit plan is different, this general guide will help you understand the basics.

## Interest-Free Financing Available

We’re pleased to offer our patients 12 months interest-free financing via CareCredit®.

### What is CareCredit®?

CareCredit® is a healthcare credit card that helps you pay for treatments and procedures for you or your family that may not be covered by insurance.  It’s free and easy to apply and you’ll receive a decision immediately.  If you’re approved, you can schedule your procedures even before you receive your card.  With more than 21 million accounts opened since CareCredit® began nearly 30 years ago, they are the trusted source for healthcare credit cards.

### Is CareCredit® for Me?

How it works

CareCredit® works like a credit card that you can use exclusively for healthcare needs.

[Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TQkU2A5VX8)

We understand that sometimes patients delay paying for the treatment they need, and that sometimes this delay compounds the health problem and results in an even more expensive dental treatment in the long run! To avoid this negative spiral, we accept payment through CareCredit® because their flexible payment plans make it easier for you to afford the treatments you need now.

You’ll need to check with CareCredit® and go through their application process to learn what sorts of promotional payment plans you may qualify for. Some of their promotional plans offer 0% interest if you pay your balance off in full within the promotional time period (subject to credit approval).

Because CareCredit® is a type of credit card, you can still incur interest charges if you fail to pay your minimum monthly balance, or fail to pay your balance within an agreed-upon time period. But if used wisely, and if you plan accordingly, it can offer the smart healthcare shopper a great way to break large payments up over time into easily-affordable ones.

### Insurance


### Patient Experience

Do you see children?

Yes, we see children at all of our offices. Our dentists are very child-friendly and we do our best to make going to the dentist a fun experience for them.

Would I have to wait long for an appointment?

Typically we can get new patients in for same day emergency appointments. Routine cleaning appointments usually have a wait time of a couple of days to a couple of weeks if the appointment time is in high demand.

What is your cancellation policy?

Our cancellation policy requires at least a 24-hour notice. Failure to do so may result in a cancellation fee penalty.

How can I transfer my records from my old dentist?

Most dental offices require a patient signature to release records. We can assist you in the transfer of your records, but the easiest way is to go into the office yourself to request your records.


Who will be the dentist I see at my visit?

The dentist you see at your first visit depends upon the location and day of the week of your initial appointment. You can request to see a particular dentist if you so choose to do so.


### Giving Back

### Technology

What is 3D imaging?

Traditional dental x-rays are a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional object. Our offices utilizes cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) for our x-rays to visualize all three dimensions of the tooth which allows for better diagnosis and overall care of our patients.

### Oral Care

What is the difference between a deep cleaning and regular cleaning?

A regular cleaning, often times referred to as a “prophy”, is a preventative cleaning that helps maintain healthy teeth and gums. A deep cleaning is performed when significant amount of bone loss and gum inflammation is present requiring removal of plaque and tartar buildup from below the gums.

How do I choose a toothbrush?

Choosing a toothbrush can be a daunting task. The dentists at Tennessee Family Dental encourage our patients to use an electronic toothbrush if at all possible, preferably one with soft bristles at a low setting as overbrushing can cause gum recession.

### Snoring & Sleep


- I had a great experience at Tennessee Family Dental! Dr. Hill was very friendly and professional. She did a great job and I highly recommend her to anyone! I will be back!

Lauren Deardorff,
- From the moment you enter the practice you're greeted by friendly people. The staff is professional and attentive. Each exam room has a TV and is clean, neat and organized. I recently had a dental filling performed and it was a stress-free, pain-free, actually "comfortable" experience. I highly recommend Tennessee Family Dental, whether you need basic cleaning or other more evasive procedures, they are efficient, effective, and painless.

James Edward Regan,


- My visits to Tennessee Family Dental have been pleasant and productive. Jan, the dental hygienist, is accommodating and very gentle. This staff will work effectively with your insurance carrier. They call with insurance related issues promptly and professionally. Enjoy your time in the capable hands of Tennessee Family Dental.

Phil LaVallie,

- I have been a patient of Dr. O'Neill's for almost 4 years and have been to every office. This was my first time at Green Hills. First of all, the decor is beautiful and all the staff are so friendly and welcoming. You are instantly greeted with a warm smile that puts your nerves at ease. I recently had problems with a crown on my tooth. I called immediately, and I was promptly called back and then seen in the office the next day. They truly care. Dental work can be nerve-racking, stressful, and painful, but not when you are at Tennessee Family Dental. They take care of their patients li...

Gina Curl,
- My husband and I have just moved to Lebanon and began the search for a dentist. By doing a search on Google I found Tennessee Family Dental. From the front staff, to the hygienist and then [the dentist]. We received nothing but excellence. So very friendly, making us feel so comfortable. Would highly recommend this dentist office to anybody who asks. Thank you everyone for your excellent service.

Kris M.,

- The most friendly, warm, and welcoming staff. Doctors were patient and understanding. Typically, I am petrified of the dentist. They made this such a great experience. Thank you guys!!!

Julie R.,
- Tennessee Family Dental took over Dr. Thaxton's practice several years ago. My family and I have been going there for over 20 years. The people and the services are top notch and continue to provide the down home but professional feel. Please give them a try. You won't be disappointed.

Jeff DuPuy,

- I had an appt for a cleaning. Ended up needing a wisdom tooth pulled. I was afraid if I procrastinated I wouldn't get it done so I asked if he could do it that day. He did. I was terrified and literally shaking. All of the staff did their best to comfort me and the actual process was not at all unpleasant. Great staff, great doctor, I highly recommend them! See you in August!

Connie Amos,
- I have been to several dentists throughout my life but TN Family Dental is by far the best around!! They go above and beyond to spend quality time with each patient making sure you are comfortable while giving you the best possible treatment. The entire staff is prompt and friendly. Jan has worked with me the past few visits and she's AMAZING! For most, the dentist is something they dread. I, on the other hand, look forward to mh visit and can't wait to go back!

Claire Chaffin,

# Patient Reviews

AllBrentwoodGreen HillsLa VergneLebanon

- I just wanted to say thank you so much for the Free Cleaning today! Everyone I spoke with at Tennessee Family Dental was so nice and I was surprised that they didn't treat me differently because I don't have dental insurance. They were so loving and kind. What a wonderful experience I had today! God Blessed me with Tennessee Family Dental!
Kat Simpson,
- I have been a patient of Dr. O'Neill's for almost 4 years and have been to every office. This was my first time at Green Hills. First of all, the decor is beautiful and all the staff are so friendly and welcoming. You are instantly greeted with a warm smile that puts your nerves at ease. I recently had problems with a crown on my tooth. I called immediately, and I was promptly called back and then seen in the office the next day. They truly care. Dental work can be nerve-racking, stressful, and painful, but not when you are at Tennessee Family Dental. They take care of their patients like family and are always there 24/7 to take care of your needs.
- I highly recommend Dr. O'Neill, Missi, and all of the staff at TN Family Dental! I'm always seen at the appointment time, and never left waiting. It never feels like I'm going to the dentist, rather I'm going to see old friends!
Genny Tidwell,
- Dr. O'Neill and his staff made this dentist fearing girl, a believer in dental care. I have avoided going for so long before them, but whether it's a simple cleaning, or a more intense procedure, they were kind, gentle, funny, and knowledgeable. I really have enjoyed every experience I have has at Tennessee Family Dental and I would recommend anyone to them. The best in town!
Ashley Silver,
- Couldn't be happier with this office. They always make me feel comfortable and take great care of me and my family.
Trevor Harrell,
- I had the opportunity to see Dr. O'Neill at TN Family Dental (Green Hills) and I had a wonderful experience! He was very engaging, personable, and professional from the moment I walked in. The office atmosphere is very welcoming, clean, and relaxing. All of my experiences with the staff of TN Family Dental and Dr. O'Neill have been extremely positive, and I recommend this location!
Emily W.,
- As a fellow dentist and patient of Tennessee Family Dental, I can say Dr O'Neill and his staff are top notch. He has a great chairside manner, no pain, and impeccable work! Excellent facilities and amazing staff!
Scarlet,
- I fell in love with this place the first day i went. Everyone is so nice and down to earth. They are just a sweet group of people and you cant find that to often now a day. Although i was in alot of pain, i walked out with a smile on my face. Keep up the great work everyone
Lavon Chandler,
- I was referred to Tennessee Family Dental in LaVergne by their sister practice in Nashville. They were open later than most and accommodated my work schedule very quickly. They did an excellent job with my exam and cleaning.
Tim Whitehead,
- I'm new to town and wanted to find a dentist that made you feel like family. This was the place! I had not had a cleaning in several years so Jan gave gave me a numbing gel to make it more comfortable. I didn't even know that was an option. THANK YOU, JAN!…The girls at the front were very sweet and efficient. The converted house gives you a comfortable feel when you walk in for your dental visit.
Rachel S.,
- "Family Dental" is a great name, because these people are like my family. Their care, expertise, and personal touch are just a few of the great things about Tennessee Family Dental.
Carter Massey,
- I don't love going to the dentist, but I relaxed once I was there thanks to their pleasant attitude and competence. The technician was very attentive, and the doctor thoroughly explained what I needed, using digital photos to illustrate. Their rates are reasonable, and did not leave me with "sticker shock"!
Daniel Bosler,
- Great consult, fantastic root canal procedure. Informative, compassionate care that I will (and have) recommend to my friends and family. New to Nashville and this is where I'll stay!
Matt McSpadden,
- Great place. I developed an abscessed tooth while on vacation in Nashville. My regular dentist was on vacation herself, so I couldn't get the antibiotics I needed. After calling several dentist offices that couldn't get me in, I found TFD and they we're able to get me in early the next morning. All of the staff was very friendly and helpful. Good experience even with the amount of pain I was in. Would definitely recommend them.
Shannon Knisley,
- I usually don't write reviews but had to let everyone know about my experience today. I hate and I mean hate the dentist and don't ever go but had some issues come up and needed to go. I found out about Tennessee Family Dental through a friend of mine and decided to give them a try. As I entered the door I was welcomed with many smiling faces and the front desk lady was very polite. They could tell I was nervous and reassured me everything was going to be okay. The girl called me back to the chair and explained exactly what they were going to do today. She asked if I had any questions and made me feel right at home. (Love the fact that they have tv's on the wall...made my nervous calm down) After all the x-rays were done [the dentist] took a look and was very gentle and listen to my concerns. He explained everything he was seeing and told me what was the best treatment plan for me. ( best part was he spoke so I could understand him, not in Doctor over my head language). I am going to continue my treatment plan with them and will recommend them to all my friends. What a wonderful experience I had with one of my biggest fears (the dentist)!!!!
- I walked into to TN Family dental and was blown away by the friendly staff and spotless facility. I had wanted to get caught up on some things. I had four and half hours of procedure done at once. Never felt a needle and never felt discomfort. You can tell when people like each other. You can tell when a staff is happy. It reflects in the work they do and the over all feel of the experience. This office is a team and I am so thankful I found them. I had a crown and veneer done with two silver fillings replaced and a cavity filled. I am more than pleased with skills of my doctor and the results. A++++ Nippers Corner Location.
- Saturday morning 4:30 AM. Roaring toothache from a long troublesome tooth. Dentist the day before could not work me in until Monday. It was time for that tooth to go. Scoured the Internet and after calling several places after 8:00 AM found Tennessee Family Dental in Nippers Corner. "Can you get here by 9:00?" 20 minutes from Green Hills, no problem. Great staff, great dentist, reasonable price. Tooth pulled and out the door in 1 hour 15 minutes. Back in ,Saturday chair by 11:00 for kickoff.
John P.,
- Our family of 7 (including our five children) love Tennessee family dental. We have been going there for years. The hygienists are so kind and patient with our children. The whole team is always welcoming and willing to listen to any concerns we may have. We highly recommend TFD for all your familie's dental needs.
Dawn Denton,
