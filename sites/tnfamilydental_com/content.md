## Reviews from our 4 Convenient Locations

- As a client of Tennessee Family Dental of Lebanon, I would recommend them to anyone moving in the area or who just would like to change dentist offices. They take excellent care of me and my family and are the best around town.

Stephanie Bentley,
- I walked into to TN Family dental and was blown away by the friendly staff and spotless facility. I had wanted to get caught up on some things. I had four and half hours of procedure done at once. Never felt a needle and never felt discomfort. You can tell when people like each other. You can tell when a staff is happy. It reflects in the work they do and the over all feel of the experience. This office is a team and I am so thankful I found them. I had a crown and veneer done with two silver fillings replaced and a cavity filled. I am more than pleased with skills of my doctor and the r...

Tim A.,

- Yesterday when my filling broke I called Tennessee family dental and they got me in the same day and at a time that worked well for me! From the moment I walked in everyone was so friendly which immediately put me at ease! [The Dr.] and his assistants made me feel like their top priority ! [He] clearly explained the crown procedure and would continuously check in on me during the procedure to make sure I was comfortable. I left feeling so happy with my final treatment and overall experience.

Emily H.,
- My sleep apnea doctor recommended I visit Dr. Farringer for a dental appliance that would remove the need for me to wear my CPAP device. What a life saver! I now sleep better without a mask attached to my face and can now travel easily without lugging around my CPAP machine and distilled water. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable.

S.P. – Smyrna, TN,

- Warm and efficient staff serve two extremely perfectionistic dentists. We have both had crown work with Dr. O'Neill and were impressed…Jan and Christy are excellent, caring hygienists. This is the answer to your dental needs.

Jean Johnson,
- I usually don't write reviews but had to let everyone know about my experience today. I hate and I mean hate the dentist and don't ever go but had some issues come up and needed to go. I found out about Tennessee Family Dental through a friend of mine and decided to give them a try. As I entered the door I was welcomed with many smiling faces and the front desk lady was very polite. They could tell I was nervous and reassured me everything was going to be okay. The girl called me back to the chair and explained exactly what they were going to do today. She asked if I had any questions an...

Sara Norton Andre,

- I had a big cavity that was causing me a bad pain. I asked if I can do a filling for it the same day that I had my six months cleaning and the doctor was very quick and agreed to work on it the same day. I got my cleaning and my filling done in no time. The staff is very friendly and caring, they made me feel very welcomed and happy. I really recommend them!!!

Miriam Gergis,
- I'm currently in Nashville for work and when I first arrived, I was in so much pain. I couldn't eat, sleep, or do my job properly. I chose TN Family Dental based on their reviews and I am so glad I did. They scheduled me in immediately, worked with my schedule, and made sure I was comfortable and pain free the entire time. If I lived in the area, I would make TN Family Dental my dentist office. They truly care about their patients and this is by far the best dental office I have ever been to.

Yvette Rojo,

- Recently moved to Nashville and lucked out with Tennessee Family Dental. The La Vergne office is closest to me and Dr. Hill is a great dentist! I have some anxiety about going to the dentist, but Dr. Hill and Theresa were patient, gentle, and made me feel as comfortable as possible. They do a really great, professional job! Highly recommend.

Lorin Santo,
- This is one of four dental offices in middle TN and they are great. The staff is always friendly and helpful and I love my dental hygienist, Jan. I highly recommend this dental office.

Donna M.,


We love our patients and want each one to have a five-star dental experience at every single visit!

## FAQs about Our Practice

How many locations does Tennessee Family Dental have?

Tennessee Family Dental has 4 locations: [Brentwood](https://tnfamilydental.com/locations/brentwood/), [Green Hills](https://tnfamilydental.com/locations/green-hills/), [Lebanon](https://tnfamilydental.com/locations/lebanon/) & [La Vergne](https://tnfamilydental.com/locations/la-vergne/).

What if I do not have dental insurance?

[Dental insurance](https://tnfamilydental.com/insurance/) is one of many ways to pay for dental treatment, but it is not the only way. Many of our patients pay for their treatment with card, cash or check. In addition, our [In-Office Benefits Plan](https://tnfamilydental.com/insurance/#in-office-benefits-plan) is a very popular alternative to traditional dental insurance.

What insurances do you accept?

Our doctors are [in-network PPO providers](https://tnfamilydental.com/insurance/) for most major dental insurance plans. If we are not in-network with your dental insurance, we will file on your behalf as a courtesy. Unfortunately, we are not HMO providers at the moment, but we are in network with TennCare at our Brentwood, La Vergne and Lebanon locations.

Can I schedule an appointment online?

Currently we are unable to accept appointment requests online. Please contact us [here](https://tnfamilydental.com/contact/).

3D Digital Dentistry - Tennessee Family Dental, Nashville TN Dentist


Our dentists utilize 3D technology to visualize your teeth.

# 3D Digital Dentistry

## 3D dentistry. Better diagnosis. Better dentistry.

3D digital dentistry is an all-encompassing term used to describe the branch of dentistry that visualizes all three dimensions of the teeth and surrounding structures. In the past, 2D imaging was the only option, often resulting in misdiagnosis due to missing information.

## About 3D Digital Dentistry

The dentists at Tennessee Family Dental have several 3D imaging systems on site that allow us to provide a more accurate diagnosis and better quality dentistry on a consistent basis. Step into a world that uses 3D imaging and cutting-edge technology to visualize your teeth, jaw bone, and surrounding structures.

## 3D Cone Beam CT imaging

Cone Beam CT (or CBCT—Cone Beam Computed Tomography) is a [medical imaging technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging_technique) used by our dentists on a daily basis in treatment planning and diagnosis. CBCT allows us to plan the step-by-step process in [implant dentistry](https://tnfamilydental.com/service/implant-dentistry/), navigate difficult [root canals](https://tnfamilydental.com/service/root-canal-therapy/), visualized impacted [wisdom teeth](https://tnfamilydental.com/service/wisdom-teeth-removal/), screen patients who are high risk for [sleep apnea](https://tnfamilydental.com/service/snoring-sleep-apnea/), and identify causes of [TMJ pain](https://tnfamilydental.com/service/tmj-migraines-headaches/). We have CBCT technology at our [Brentwood](https://tnfamilydental.com/locations/brentwood/), [Green Hills](https://tnfamilydental.com/locations/green-hills/), and [Lebanon](https://tnfamilydental.com/locations/lebanon/) offices because we believe that our patients deserve the best.

## 3D Airway Analysis

Sleep apnea screening can be performed using CBCT by visualizing the anatomy of the upper airway. This 3D airway analysis highlights areas of narrowing that may contribute to sleep apnea. Our dentists are able to use this screening process to identify patients who are high risk for sleep apnea due to the anatomy of their airway. A sleep apnea test is then ordered for high risk patients to determine if the patient suffers from sleep apnea. Many of our patients claim that this 3D airway analysis screening process helped “save their life,” as it was the first step in receiving treatment for this potentially fatal condition.

## CEREC Digital Impressions

Improved accuracy and better fitting dental restorations are made possible with digital impressions. Our dentists at [Green Hills](https://tnfamilydental.com/locations/green-hills/) and [Lebanon](https://tnfamilydental.com/locations/lebanon/) utilize CEREC digital impression cutting-edge technology to create a virtual model of the teeth and surrounding tissue. This 3D digital technology captures highly accurate impression data without the need for traditional impressions, which can be inconvenient, time-consuming, and messy. The impression data is sent to our in-house dental lab, [Deuce-One Dental Lab](http://21dentallab.com/), that will begin making your custom crown under the guidance and supervision of your Tennessee Family Dental dentist. The dentist is able to evaluate the design of the crown before it is finalized and has the ability to see exactly what the crown will look like on the tooth – in 3D! Experience digital dental impressions. Experience the future of dentistry.

## How we can help

Tennessee Family Dental believes in using 3D imaging systems that allow our dentists to provide you with a better overall patient experience. Our leading-edge technology can help our dentists diagnose your dental condition more accurately leaving you confident in your treatment decision.

Cosmetic Dentistry - Tennessee Family Dental, Nashville TN Dentist

## About Cosmetic Dentistry

Selecting a qualified cosmetic dentist to transform your smile can be quite the challenge. There are several considerations to be aware of when making your decision, including cost, technique, and treatment philosophy.

### Cost

We pride ourselves as being one of the top dental offices in Nashville, Tennessee, in terms of affordability and quality. Our dentists deliver consistent cosmetic dentistry results at an affordable price. We understand that no one likes financial surprises at the end of treatment, and we avoid this by giving our patients a detailed cost breakdown at their initial consultation. We even offer [third-party financing options](https://tnfamilydental.com/insurance/#carecredit).

### Technique

Transforming smiles is no easy business. We have invested in leading-edge technology, allowing us to deliver the highest standard of care for our patients. Our technique involves a detailed, comprehensive evaluation at your initial visit, during which we discuss your primary concerns. You talk, we listen. In this initial consultation, we utilize [3D digital dentistry technology](https://tnfamilydental.com/service/3d-digital-dentistry/), giving you the most accurate treatment plan for your cosmetic procedure. After the initial consultation, we begin treatment with your primary concerns in mind, and we are finished only when you are completely satisfied with your new smile.

### Treatment Philosophy

Before you commit to a dentist to perform your cosmetic dental procedure, you should request a “sneak peak” at the final product. With our Smile Design Software, patients can see the end product before we begin treatment. Careful treatment planning and effective communication with our patients allows our dentists to deliver predictable, aesthetic results. Our philosophy is “start with the end in mind.”

Implant Dentistry - Tennessee Family Dental, Nashville TN Dentist


Enjoy a healthy smile again with an implant that looks just like a natural tooth.

# Implant Dentistry

## Replace missing teeth with affordable dental implants.

Permanent tooth replacement with dental implants can transform your smile. One of the most advanced and predictable techniques is to replace missing teeth by permanently attaching a replacement tooth to a dental implant. Anchored in the jawbone, implants provide long-term stability and restore chewing function. Implant-supported teeth look like natural teeth and are maintained in the same way–with regular brushing and flossing.

## About Dental Implants

## Are they safe and affordable?

Our dentists have helped hundreds of patients replace their missing teeth with dental implants. There are several reasons why an implant at Tennessee Family Dental may be the best decision you can make for your smile:

Safe

A dental implant is a small, root-shaped post that is placed below the gums. The position of the implant can be determined with a “surgical guide” that guides the implant into place. Our dentists will create a surgical guide for our patients to wear during the implant procedure. We do this by virtually simulating the placement of the implant on our state-of-the-art computer software that utilizes cone beam technology.

Predictable

3D imaging technology allows our dentists to give you the most predictable treatment results possible. Weeks before the implant procedure, our dentists virtually measure the width and depth of the bone on the 3D cone beam image of your jawbone so the implant is placed at the ideal depth and angle. We virtually show you this step-by-step process before we begin treatment. Once you approve, the implant placement appointment is scheduled.


At Tennessee Family Dental, we offer special “bundle pricing” for all our dental implants that includes costs for all necessary treatment. Our bundle pricing gives you an approximate 20% discount off the total costs of each individual treatment step of the implant process: exams, X-rays, bone grafts, surgical guide, 3D cone beam image, implant, abutment, and implant crown. You are under one roof for the entire procedure, from start to finish. No additional costs. No surprise fees at the end.

At your complimentary implant consultation, we will go over the exact costs and explain each step and the time required to complete each step.

Sedation Dentistry - Tennessee Family Dental, Nashville TN Dentist


Maximize your comfort and minimize your anxiety with one of our sedation options.

# Sedation Dentistry

## Anxiety-free, pain-free dental appointments.

Does the thought of going to the dentist paralyze you in fear? Would you rather endure a toothache or dental emergency than visit the dentist? If so, you are not alone. Approximately 40 million Americans avoid the dentist because of fear and anxiety, according to the Academy of General Dentistry. The good news is that Tennessee Family Dental has a team of highly-trained dentists who have completed advanced courses and training in sedation dentistry.


## About Sedation Dentistry

Sedation Dentistry can benefit patients who do not enjoy the sights and sounds of a dental appointment, allowing them to relax and experience comfort during the procedure. We offer multiple levels of sedation, ranging in cost from $49 – $299, depending on the type of drug used during the sedation appointment.

### What is Sedation Dentistry?

Sedation dentistry is a service we offer to our patients to help them relax during their dental procedure. The primary goal is to reduce your anxiety and give you the most comfortable dental experience possible. In addition to reducing anxiety, our higher levels of sedation also affect your memory, so, although conscious, you will have little or no memory of your dental appointment.

### Types of Sedation Dentistry

We offer different levels of sedation, including [laughing gas sedation](https://tnfamilydental.com/service/sedation-dentistry/laughing-gas/) and [oral conscious sedation](https://tnfamilydental.com/service/oral-conscious-sedation/), depending on the patient’s preference and level of anxiety. Additional training and a special permit are required for dentists to provide oral conscious sedation and administer oral sedatives. Sedation dentistry also includes IV Sedation, where an anesthesiologist comes into the office to administer an even higher level of sedation.

### Is Sedation Dentistry Safe?

Sedation dentistry is offered to our healthy adult patients who have completed a [free sedation consultation](https://tnfamilydental.com/contact/?dental_procedure=free_smile_consultation#form), during which the dentist reviews your medical history and medications and answers any questions you have regarding the sedation appointment. You can use our [online form](https://tnfamilydental.com/contact/?dental_procedure=sedation_dentistry#form) to set up your complimentary sedation dentistry consultation appointment with a Tennessee Family Dental dentist at one of our locations in [Brentwood](https://tnfamilydental.com/locations/brentwood/), [Green Hills](https://tnfamilydental.com/locations/green-hills/), [Lebanon](https://tnfamilydental.com/locations/lebanon/), or [La Vergne](https://tnfamilydental.com/locations/la-vergne/).

Snoring & Sleep Apnea - Tennessee Family Dental, Nashville TN Dentist


Live better by breathing better with an oral appliance to treat your snoring and sleep apnea.

# Snoring & Sleep Apnea

## We can help facilitate a sleep apnea test in the privacy of your own home.

Tennessee Family Dental offers a FREE screening and evaluation of your risk for snoring or sleep apnea at our four convenient locations in [Brentwood](https://tnfamilydental.com/locations/brentwood/), [Green Hills](https://tnfamilydental.com/locations/green-hills/), [Lebanon](https://tnfamilydental.com/locations/lebanon/), and [La Vergne](https://tnfamilydental.com/locations/la-vergne/). Your appointment includes a one-on-one consultation with a dentist trained in dental sleep medicine. We will go over your sleep history and discuss treatment options with you if you have already been diagnosed.

### Having trouble sleeping at night?

[Free Screening & Evaluation](http://tnfamilydental.com/contact/?dental_procedure=free_snoring_sleep_apnea#form "Link")We will discuss sleep apnea testing, costs and treatment options at your initial sleep consultation.

*One-on-One with a trained medical professional

## Patient Testimonial

### Snoring

The muscles that keep your airway open during the day are relaxed while you sleep. This causes tissue to vibrate along the narrow portions of your airway during your sleep, resulting in snoring.

Snoring can be one of many signs of a serious medical condition called sleep apnea. A diagnosis of snoring is often referred to as “primary snoring.” Just because you snore does not mean you have sleep apnea, and not everyone who has sleep apnea snores. If you snore, you may be high-risk for sleep apnea, and a sleep study is needed to determine if you have a breathing-related sleep disorder such as obstructive sleep apnea.

### Sleep Apnea

Sleep Apnea is a serious medical condition that results in decreased oxygen to the brain due to interruptions in breathing. Each time normal breathing stops, the brain is depleted of oxygen and is unable to send “distress signals” to tell the muscles in the airway to open. These episodes can last more than 10 seconds and can occur hundreds of times each night, although most people who suffer from sleep apnea do not remember gasping or snorting during the night. As a result, these patients wake up feeling groggy and experience excessive daytime sleepiness, along with other signs and symptoms. You may suffer from sleep apnea and not even know it. A sleep study is needed to determine if you suffer from snoring or sleep apnea.

### Breathe Better While You Sleep

In most cases, your Tennessee Family Dental office can treat your sleep apnea with a comfortable oral appliance that will help you breathe better while you sleep. This oral appliance is covered by most medical insurances and compared to other snoring and sleep apnea treatments, like surgery and CPAP, oral appliance therapy has been designed with patient comfort in mind—small, gentle & comfortable.

### Home Sleep Apnea Tests

If your dentist determines that you are high-risk for sleep apnea, we will send you home with a small, highly accurate diagnostic solution that will analyze your breathing. You simply take home a user-friendly Home Sleep Apnea Test (HSAT) that you’ll wear while you sleep naturally in the comfort and privacy of your own bed. Bring the testing device back to our office the next morning, and in less than a week you will have your results from a Board Certified Sleep Physician. We will then explain all your treatment options and present our treatment recommendations. In some cases, additional testing under the supervision of a physician may be necessary.

Same Day Crowns - Tennessee Family Dental, Nashville TN Dentist


Your dental crown can be completed in a couple of hours. No extra appointments. No extra time off work.

# Same Day Crowns

## Relax. We can start and finish your crown in a single day.

Single-visit procedures have revolutionized the way we do dentistry. If you are in need of a crown, you might be concerned about the length of time and preparation work that it takes from start to finish. We can complete the entire crown process in a single day. This is done by using advanced CAD/CAM technology to image the tooth and create a permanent crown restoration that is ready within a couple hours.

## About Same Day Crowns

Crowns usually require two visits, but we offer same-day dental crowns at our [Green Hills](https://tnfamilydental.com/locations/green-hills/) and [Lebanon](https://tnfamilydental.com/locations/lebanon/) locations. We offer this service to our patients so they do not have to wait the standard two to three weeks to complete the crown.

At your initial appointment, your dentist will examine the tooth and determine the appropriate treatment. It could be a simple filling, inlay/onlay, or a full coverage crown, depending on the amount of tooth structure remaining. Once the tooth has been prepared, a 3D virtual model of your teeth will be created using an intraoral video camera. This camera will take a “digital impression” of your teeth so the porcelain restoration can be made. This information is immediately sent to the lab, where they begin processing the information. As soon as the appointment is over, the crown process begins. In most cases, a temporary tooth is not needed, since the crown will be cemented on the same day.

Our in-house dental lab, [Deuce-One Dental Lab](http://21dentallab.com/), will begin making your custom crown under the guidance and supervision of your Tennessee Family Dental dentist. The dentist will evaluate the design of the crown before it is finalized and has the ability to see exactly what the crown will look like on the tooth – in 3D! No metal is used for these types of crowns since they are 100% porcelain. You will approve the size, shape, and color of the crown once it has been tried in by your dentist. After your approval, your tooth-colored restoration is cemented into place, and your crown is complete…in a single day!

The Tennessee Family Dental team guarantees that we can see you ASAP if you have a broken tooth. Our Green Hills and Lebanon offices offer same day dental crowns for patients needing treatment.

Invisalign® Clear Braces - Tennessee Family Dental, Nashville TN Dentist


A clear alternative to braces. This is how science moves your smile.

# Invisalign® Clear Braces

## Smile healthy with Invisalign® clear braces.

Invisalign® is the modern solution to healthier, straighter teeth. Our dentists provide naturally beautiful smiles utilizing this high-tech treatment approach. At Tennessee Family Dental, we have dentists who are Certified Invisalign® Providers, which means they have undergone advanced training and have experience using Invisalign®. If you are interested in Invisalign® clear braces, you can schedule a complimentary smile evaluation.

## Straight Teeth Made Simple

Invisalign® is a comprehensive orthodontic system that uses a series of clear aligners to move your teeth into a better position. Each Invisalign® aligner is worn for approximately two weeks, and you will remove them only to eat, brush, and floss. Each aligner will move the teeth little by little until they have straightened to the final position. Our Invisalign® treatment takes 9 to 18 months. In contrast, traditional orthodontics can take two years or longer! The aligners are almost impossible to see when they are in place, giving them the “invisible braces” nickname.

## Invisalign® treats the following common orthodontic conditions:

Excessive Spacing

Due to abnormal growth of the jaw bone or missing teeth

Excessive Crowding

Due to a lack of room for all your teeth in your jawbone

Deep Bites (“Overbites”)

Due to the upper teeth covering too much of the lower teeth

Crossbites

Due to misalignment of the upper and lower jaws

Underbites

Due to the lower teeth protruding past the upper front teeth

Open Bite

Due genetic abnormal jaw structure or excessive thumb-sucking.

## What to Expect / Treatment Process

One of the most common questions we get asked is, “How long does is take?” The length of treatment depends on the severity of your case and can only be determined by your doctor; however, the average case takes about 12 months for adults. The length of time necessary for a teen patient may vary and can be determined by your doctor.

Initial Appointment

Your initial appointment will include:

- Discussion of your orthodontic treatment goals.
- Comprehensive evaluation of your smile, teeth, and bite.
- Overview of the basics of Invisalign®.
- Discussion of treatment time expectations.
- Presentation of treatment fees and financing options.

Second Appointment

Your second appointment will include:

- Dental Impressions
- Photos
- X-Rays
- Bite registration
- Begin “Invisalign Outcome Simulator”

Invisalign Outcome Simulator

What is the “Invisalign® Outcome Simulator”?

At your second appointment, we will start an “Invisalign Outcome Simulator” so you can digitally preview the aesthetic end results prior to beginning treatment. Once you approve the digital design of how your teeth will look after treatment, then your treatment begins. You will know the final position of your teeth before you decide if Invisalign® is right for you.

[Read More FAQs](#faqs "FAQs")

## Invisalign® Costs

The cost of Invisalign® depends on the duration of treatment. Each patient has a different treatment timeline depending on the severity of the misalignment of the teeth. Invisalign® costs at Tennessee Family Dental range from $3,600 to $5,500 with 0% Financing Available. At your initial Invisalign® evaluation, we will provide you with a detailed treatment timeline so there are no surprises at the end.

## Invisalign® FAQs

What are aligners made of, and what do they look like?

The virtually invisible aligners, which are made of a thermoplastic material uniquely developed for the Invisalign treatment plan, look similar to teeth-whitening trays. A series of Invisalign aligners are custom-made for you, to move your teeth in the sequence determined during our appointments with you.

How do the aligners straighten teeth?

Over the course of treatment, you will be supplied with a series of aligners. Each aligner will make slight adjustments to tooth position, a process that is mapped out in advance, specifically for your situation. When the aligners are placed on the teeth, they cause the teeth to gradually shift from their current position. After approximately two weeks, you will begin using the next set of aligners, which will continue the teeth straightening process.

How will Invisalign effectively move my teeth?

Through the use of our patented thermoplastic design, Invisalign aligners move your teeth through the appropriate placement of controlled force. The main difference is that Invisalign not only controls the force, but also the timing of the force application. During each stage, only certain teeth are allowed to move. These movements are determined as we map out your unique Invisalign treatment plan.

What are the primary benefits of Invisalign®?

Invisalign® aligners are virtually invisible. No one may even notice that you’re wearing them, making Invisalign® a seamless fit with your lifestyle. Invisalign® aligners are removable. For the best results and a timely outcome, aligners should be worn for 20 to 22 hours per day. However, unlike with braces, you have the flexibility to remove your aligners to eat and drink what you want during treatment. And you can also remove the aligners to brush and floss as you normally would, for fresh breath and good oral hygiene. There are no metal brackets or wires that could cause irritation to your mouth, an advantage over traditional braces. Plus, since your office visits during treatment don’t involve metal or wire adjustments, you’ll likely spend less time in the doctor’s chair. Invisalign® allows you to view your virtual results and treatment plan before you start so you can see how your straightened teeth will look when your treatment is complete. Instead of imagining how much better it can be, you’ll be able to see it for yourself.

Will Invisalign treatment be painful?

While Invisalign moves your teeth without the pain and anxiety metal braces can cause, some people experience temporary discomfort for a few days at the beginning of each new stage of treatment. This is normal and is typically described as a feeling of pressure. It’s also a sign that Invisalign is working, as it moves your teeth to their final destination. This discomfort typically goes away in a couple of days.

How long will treatment take?

The length of treatment depends on the severity of your case and can only be determined by your doctor; however, the average case takes about 12 months for adults. The length of time necessary for a teen patient may vary and can be determined by your doctor.

Are there restrictions as to what I can eat while in treatment?

No. Thanks to the removable nature of the aligners, you can eat and drink whatever you want while in treatment. In fact, you’re required to remove your aligners to eat and drink. So, unlike when undergoing traditional treatment using wires and brackets, there is no need to restrict your consumption of any of your favorite foods and snacks unless you are instructed otherwise by your doctor. Also, it is important that you brush your teeth after each meal and prior to reinserting your aligners to maintain fresh breath and proper hygiene.

How often must I see my Invisalign doctor?

Your doctor will schedule regular appointments usually about once every four to six weeks. The goal of these visits is to ensure that your treatment is progressing as planned.

How often must I wear my aligners?

We find that aligners are most effective when worn 20 to 22 hours per day and removed only for eating, brushing and flossing.

Can I just wear the aligners while I sleep?

No. The aligners must be in place a minimum of 20 to 22 hours a day for the treatment to be effective.

I am currently wearing braces. Can I make the switch to Invisalign?

Doctors are treating a significant number of patients with a combination of braces and Invisalign. Consult your Invisalign doctor to determine the best treatment for you.

Since having my braces removed, my teeth have shifted. Can Invisalign fix this?

A number of Invisalign patients have undergone a previous treatment involving braces at some point in their past, often during their youth. Adults can usually have the shifting that occurs after braces corrected, without having to go through the trauma and social awkwardness of wearing metal braces.

Will I need to wear a retainer after treatment to prevent my teeth from moving again?

Most doctors recommend that anyone who has completed orthodontic treatment, whether braces or Invisalign treatment, use a retainer to prevent teeth from gradually shifting back towards their initial position. Because every case is different, please speak to your doctor to confirm if you need post-treatment retainers, and if they are needed for both upper and lower teeth.

Will wearing Invisalign aligners affect my speech?

Similar to other orthodontic treatments, Invisalign aligners may temporarily affect the speech of some people, and you may have a slight lisp for a day or two. However, as your tongue gets used to having aligners in your mouth, any lisp caused by the aligners should disappear.

## Interest-Free Financing Available

We’re pleased to offer our patients 12 months interest-free financing via CareCredit®.

### What is CareCredit®?

CareCredit® is a healthcare credit card that helps you pay for treatments and procedures for you or your family that may not be covered by insurance.  It’s free and easy to apply and you’ll receive a decision immediately.  If you’re approved, you can schedule your procedures even before you receive your card.  With more than 21 million accounts opened since CareCredit® began nearly 30 years ago, they are the trusted source for healthcare credit cards.

### Is CareCredit® for Me?

How it works

CareCredit® works like a credit card that you can use exclusively for healthcare needs.

[Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TQkU2A5VX8)

We understand that sometimes patients delay paying for the treatment they need, and that sometimes this delay compounds the health problem and results in an even more expensive dental treatment in the long run! To avoid this negative spiral, we accept payment through CareCredit® because their flexible payment plans make it easier for you to afford the treatments you need now.

You’ll need to check with CareCredit® and go through their application process to learn what sorts of promotional payment plans you may qualify for. Some of their promotional plans offer 0% interest if you pay your balance off in full within the promotional time period (subject to credit approval).

Because CareCredit® is a type of credit card, you can still incur interest charges if you fail to pay your minimum monthly balance, or fail to pay your balance within an agreed-upon time period. But if used wisely, and if you plan accordingly, it can offer the smart healthcare shopper a great way to break large payments up over time into easily-affordable ones.

Reviews & Testimonials - Tennessee Family Dental, Nashville TN Dentist


# Patient Reviews

AllBrentwoodGreen HillsLa VergneLebanon

- From the moment you enter the practice you're greeted by friendly people. The staff is professional and attentive. Each exam room has a TV and is clean, neat and organized. I recently had a dental filling performed and it was a stress-free, pain-free, actually "comfortable" experience. I highly recommend Tennessee Family Dental, whether you need basic cleaning or other more evasive procedures, they are efficient, effective, and painless.
James Edward Regan,
- I just wanted to say thank you so much for the Free Cleaning today! Everyone I spoke with at Tennessee Family Dental was so nice and I was surprised that they didn't treat me differently because I don't have dental insurance. They were so loving and kind. What a wonderful experience I had today! God Blessed me with Tennessee Family Dental!
Kat Simpson,
- I have been a patient of Dr. O'Neill's for almost 4 years and have been to every office. This was my first time at Green Hills. First of all, the decor is beautiful and all the staff are so friendly and welcoming. You are instantly greeted with a warm smile that puts your nerves at ease. I recently had problems with a crown on my tooth. I called immediately, and I was promptly called back and then seen in the office the next day. They truly care. Dental work can be nerve-racking, stressful, and painful, but not when you are at Tennessee Family Dental. They take care of their patients like family and are always there 24/7 to take care of your needs.
Gina Curl,
- I highly recommend Dr. O'Neill, Missi, and all of the staff at TN Family Dental! I'm always seen at the appointment time, and never left waiting. It never feels like I'm going to the dentist, rather I'm going to see old friends!
Genny Tidwell,
- Dr. O'Neill and his staff made this dentist fearing girl, a believer in dental care. I have avoided going for so long before them, but whether it's a simple cleaning, or a more intense procedure, they were kind, gentle, funny, and knowledgeable. I really have enjoyed every experience I have has at Tennessee Family Dental and I would recommend anyone to them. The best in town!

Lavon Chandler,
- I have been to several dentists throughout my life but TN Family Dental is by far the best around!! They go above and beyond to spend quality time with each patient making sure you are comfortable while giving you the best possible treatment. The entire staff is prompt and friendly. Jan has worked with me the past few visits and she's AMAZING! For most, the dentist is something they dread. I, on the other hand, look forward to mh visit and can't wait to go back!
Claire Chaffin,
- I was referred to Tennessee Family Dental in LaVergne by their sister practice in Nashville. They were open later than most and accommodated my work schedule very quickly. They did an excellent job with my exam and cleaning.
Tim Whitehead,
- The most friendly, warm, and welcoming staff. Doctors were patient and understanding. Typically, I am petrified of the dentist. They made this such a great experience. Thank you guys!!!
Julie R.,
- I'm new to town and wanted to find a dentist that made you feel like family. This was the place! I had not had a cleaning in several years so Jan gave gave me a numbing gel to make it more comfortable. I didn't even know that was an option. THANK YOU, JAN!…The girls at the front were very sweet and efficient. The converted house gives you a comfortable feel when you walk in for your dental visit.
Rachel S.,
- "Family Dental" is a great name, because these people are like my family. Their care, expertise, and personal touch are just a few of the great things about Tennessee Family Dental.
Carter Massey,
- My husband and I have just moved to Lebanon and began the search for a dentist. By doing a search on Google I found Tennessee Family Dental. From the front staff, to the hygienist and then [the dentist]. We received nothing but excellence. So very friendly, making us feel so comfortable. Would highly recommend this dentist office to anybody who asks. Thank you everyone for your excellent service.
Kris M.,
- Tennessee Family Dental took over Dr. Thaxton's practice several years ago. My family and I have been going there for over 20 years. The people and the services are top notch and continue to provide the down home but professional feel. Please give them a try. You won't be disappointed.
Jeff DuPuy,
- I don't love going to the dentist, but I relaxed once I was there thanks to their pleasant attitude and competence. The technician was very attentive, and the doctor thoroughly explained what I needed, using digital photos to illustrate. Their rates are reasonable, and did not leave me with "sticker shock"!
Daniel Bosler,
- I had a great experience at Tennessee Family Dental! Dr. Hill was very friendly and professional. She did a great job and I highly recommend her to anyone! I will be back!
Lauren Deardorff,
- Great consult, fantastic root canal procedure. Informative, compassionate care that I will (and have) recommend to my friends and family. New to Nashville and this is where I'll stay!
Matt McSpadden,
- Great place. I developed an abscessed tooth while on vacation in Nashville. My regular dentist was on vacation herself, so I couldn't get the antibiotics I needed. After calling several dentist offices that couldn't get me in, I found TFD and they we're able to get me in early the next morning. All of the staff was very friendly and helpful. Good experience even with the amount of pain I was in. Would definitely recommend them.
Shannon Knisley,
- I usually don't write reviews but had to let everyone know about my experience today. I hate and I mean hate the dentist and don't ever go but had some issues come up and needed to go. I found out about Tennessee Family Dental through a friend of mine and decided to give them a try. As I entered the door I was welcomed with many smiling faces and the front desk lady was very polite. They could tell I was nervous and reassured me everything was going to be okay. The girl called me back to the chair and explained exactly what they were going to do today. She asked if I had any questions and made me feel right at home. (Love the fact that they have tv's on the wall...made my nervous calm down) After all the x-rays were done [the dentist] took a look and was very gentle and listen to my concerns. He explained everything he was seeing and told me what was the best treatment plan for me. ( best part was he spoke so I could understand him, not in Doctor over my head language). I am going to continue my treatment plan with them and will recommend them to all my friends. What a wonderful experience I had with one of my biggest fears (the dentist)!!!!
- I walked into to TN Family dental and was blown away by the friendly staff and spotless facility. I had wanted to get caught up on some things. I had four and half hours of procedure done at once. Never felt a needle and never felt discomfort. You can tell when people like each other. You can tell when a staff is happy. It reflects in the work they do and the over all feel of the experience. This office is a team and I am so thankful I found them. I had a crown and veneer done with two silver fillings replaced and a cavity filled. I am more than pleased with skills of my doctor and the results. A++++ Nippers Corner Location.
- Saturday morning 4:30 AM. Roaring toothache from a long troublesome tooth. Dentist the day before could not work me in until Monday. It was time for that tooth to go. Scoured the Internet and after calling several places after 8:00 AM found Tennessee Family Dental in Nippers Corner. "Can you get here by 9:00?" 20 minutes from Green Hills, no problem. Great staff, great dentist, reasonable price. Tooth pulled and out the door in 1 hour 15 minutes. Back in ,Saturday chair by 11:00 for kickoff.
John P.,
- My visits to Tennessee Family Dental have been pleasant and productive. Jan, the dental hygienist, is accommodating and very gentle. This staff will work effectively with your insurance carrier. They call with insurance related issues promptly and professionally. Enjoy your time in the capable hands of Tennessee Family Dental.
Phil LaVallie,
- I had an appt for a cleaning. Ended up needing a wisdom tooth pulled. I was afraid if I procrastinated I wouldn't get it done so I asked if he could do it that day. He did. I was terrified and literally shaking. All of the staff did their best to comfort me and the actual process was not at all unpleasant. Great staff, great doctor, I highly recommend them! See you in August!
Connie Amos,
- Our family of 7 (including our five children) love Tennessee family dental. We have been going there for years. The hygienists are so kind and patient with our children. The whole team is always welcoming and willing to listen to any concerns we may have. We highly recommend TFD for all your familie's dental needs.
Dawn Denton,
