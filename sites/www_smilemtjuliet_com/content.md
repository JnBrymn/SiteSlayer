- Crystal D., 5 Star Google Review

  There are so many things about being a special needs family that are hard. Finding a dentist shouldn't be one of those things. With Dr. Mike and his staff, we not only found dental care, we found a family. Dr. Mike treats my children like his own. Not just dental care, but compassionate dental care. And, I love the convenience of special needs dentistry and dentistry for the rest of my family all under one roof!
- Judy M., 5 Star Google Review

  Wow, these folks are great. I had tooth work done for a crown today and felt no pain. Everyone here was caring and kind. I have been searching for a great dentist since I moved here a year ago. Thanks to a root canal (yuck!) I was referred here for the crown. Everything has a silver lining right? Even a root canal. :) A big THUMBS UP to Dr Mike and Brenda for their care today.
- Mike H., 5 Star Google Review

  My entire family is patients at Old Hickory Family Dentistry. Dr. Glasmeier is extremely knowledgeable in modern dentistry techniques and his staff provides that special personal touch that you desire. If you are looking for an ongoing dental relationship or have a unique dental situation, I highly recommend Dr. Glasmeier.

In response to numerous requests from patients, Generations Dental Arts has added Botox treatments for both therapeutic and cosmetic purposes, along with dermal filler options for the reduction of wrinkles near the mouth, sides of nose, and chin. Learn more about this procedure below!   
  
For inquiries or to schedule an appointment, please contact our office today.  
  
**What Is BOTOX?**

Botox (formally called Botulinum Toxin) is an extremely popular method for obtaining a more youthful, rested appearance. Botox is an FDA-approved treatment which can cause facial expression lines or wrinkles to essentially disappear. Areas most frequently treated are the glabellar area of frown lines (located between the eyes), crow's feet (lateral areas of the eyes), and forehead wrinkles. Botox is diluted to a very controlled solution and, when injected into the muscles with a very thin needle, is almost painless. Botox injections produce a more youthful appearance by softening deep wrinkles.  
  
**What does** **treatment** **involve?**

Treatment involves injecting small amounts of Botox into the tiny muscles responsible for the movements that create the lines and wrinkles. This relaxes the muscle, reducing the lines and wrinkles and producing smoother skin in the treated areas.

The most common treatment areas include:

  
While both Botox and dermal fillers are exciting additions to our services for patients, they are serious procedures which involve some risk and not every patient is an appropriate candidate.

For inquiries or to schedule an appointment, please contact our office today.

- Call: [(615) 758-9117](tel:(615) 758-9117)

During the initial consultation, you will discuss your smile makeover goals and work with one of our experienced dentists to design a treatment plan that can meet your unique needs.

We will first conduct a [routine dental exam](https://www.smilemtjuliet.com/dental-exams-and-x-rays.html) to make sure that your teeth and gums are healthy before beginning any cosmetic procedures. Once your treatment plan has been created, you will then be able to see a “preview” of your new smile using our state-of-the-art computer imaging technology.

During this time, you will be able to choose the ideal shape and shade of your teeth while using visual references to help ensure that you and our dentist have the same expectations going into your smile makeover procedure.

A smile makeover can include cosmetic and restorative treatments such as [porcelain veneers](https://www.smilemtjuliet.com/dental-veneers.html), [porcelain crowns](https://www.smilemtjuliet.com/porcelain-crowns.html), dental bonding, [dental implants](https://www.smilemtjuliet.com/dental-implants.html), and [teeth whitening](https://www.smilemtjuliet.com/teeth-whitening.html). These methods are used together to transform your smile!

There are so many things about being a special needs family that are hard. Finding a dentist shouldn't be one of those things. With Dr. Mike and his staff, we not only found dental care, we found a family. Dr. Mike treats my children like his own. Not just dental care, but compassionate dental care. And, I love the convenience of special needs dentistry and dentistry for the rest of my family all under one roof!

- Crystal D., 5 Star Google Review

Wow, these folks are great. I had tooth work done for a crown today and felt no pain. Everyone here was caring and kind. I have been searching for a great dentist since I moved here a year ago. Thanks to a root canal (yuck!) I was referred here for the crown. Everything has a silver lining right? Even a root canal. :) A big THUMBS UP to Dr Mike and Brenda for their care today.

- Judy M., 5 Star Google Review

My entire family is patients at Old Hickory Family Dentistry. Dr. Glasmeier is extremely knowledgeable in modern dentistry techniques and his staff provides that special personal touch that you desire. If you are looking for an ongoing dental relationship or have a unique dental situation, I highly recommend Dr. Glasmeier.

- Mike H., 5 Star Google Review

I've been a patient of Dr. Helms for more than 20 years. I never thought I'd find another dentist who could meet his high standards and phenomenal service but I was wrong. Dr. Glasmeier is the perfect addition to this dental office!

# Teeth Whitening

Our teeth can discolor through the years as our enamel wears down. The wearing down of enamel allows dentin, a yellow color substance that makes the core of our teeth, to show through. This is what gives our teeth a yellowish tint. Teeth whitening helps restore teeth to a shiny white color through the use of bleach.  
  
Teeth whitening methods  
There are two popular teeth whitening options available through your dentist. The first, in-office teeth whitening, produces a significant color change in your teeth in a short amount of time, usually within an hour. The procedure is done at the dentist's office by applying a high-concentration peroxide gel on the teeth after they have been protected with a special shield.  
  
The second method involves the use of take-home whitening kits. These whitening kits are purchased from your doctor for use at home. The strength of the gel used in these kits is lower than that used for in-office bleaching, and thus the gel can be applied for longer periods of time. Usually, the trays are worn a couple hours a day or overnight for a few days or weeks depending on the product.  
  
It's best to consult your dentist to understand which whitening option is best for you.

Dental implants are becoming an increasingly popular method for replacing missing teeth. In this procedure, titanium supports are surgically fused with your jawbone, and act as an anchor for naturally looking false teeth. Dental implants are not only used for individual tooth replacement, but can also be used when replacing multiple teeth as an alternative to dentures.   
  
Advantages of dental implants  

- Implants are extremely natural looking
- Fusion of the implants into your jaw make them very stable and comfortable compared to traditional dentures
- They last a lifetime

  
Disadvantages of dental implants  

- Implants are expensive and a major financial investment
- The process of getting implants can be time consuming and requires multiple visits to the dentist
- There is a chance the surgery fails (roughly 5% of the time)

  
Types of implants  
Your dentist will be able to tell you which of the three types of implants is right for you:   

- Root form implant: This is the most common type of implant where the screw is shaped like the root of a tooth.
- Plate Form Implant:A plate form implant has a flat and long shape and is better suited for a narrow jawbone.
- Subperiosteal Implants: In some cases where there is not enough bone width or height for the root form or plate form implant, a subperiosteal implant may be prescribed. This type of implant is designed to sit on top of the bone, but under the gums.

- **No more slipping or clicking** – enjoy meals and conversations without worry.
- **Improved comfort** – less irritation to the gums.
- **Easier maintenance** – dentures can still be removed for cleaning.
- **Faster healing** – most patients resume normal activities within 24–48 hours.

---
1. **Consultation & Planning**: Your dentist will evaluate your oral health and take X-rays or a CT scan.
2. **Placement**: Using local anesthesia, the implants are placed into the jawbone. No cutting or stitches are typically required.
3. **Attachment**: Dentures are modified or fabricated to connect securely to the implants.
4. **Follow-Up**: Regular checkups ensure the implants are functioning properly.
However, they may not be ideal for replacing individual teeth or supporting full arch restorations in all cases.

---

### Cost and Longevity

Mini implants are generally more affordable than traditional implants, but pricing can vary depending on how many implants are needed and the type of denture used. With proper care, mini implants can last many years, though they may have a slightly shorter lifespan than standard implants.

---

### Final Thoughts

Mini dental implants offer a smart, effective, and budget-friendly way to stabilize dentures and reclaim a better quality of life. If you're tired of denture adhesives or the embarrassment of slipping dentures, talk to your dentist about whether mini implants are right for you.

**Your smile deserves to be strong, stable, and confident—no matter your age. Give us a call so we can book a consultation for you!**
