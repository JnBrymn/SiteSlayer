Hi Dr. Chaiken,

I’ve been browsing North Dental Professionals’ site, and I’m impressed by your commitment to patient comfort and personalized dental care in both Chicago and Skokie. You offer a truly comprehensive range of services—cosmetic, restorative, emergency, family dentistry, and more—all balanced with genuine warmth.

I’m Zac, founder of SlayDigital.ai. We help practices like yours save time and improve patient experience by building custom, easy-to-use AI web agents. These agents let your visitors ask questions via a simple chat box, and receive instant answers based on the information already on your site.

I’ve set up a brief demo using a mock version of your website here: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_northdentalprofessionals_com  
Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner and type a question—your site’s “virtual dental team” will answer right away.

You can try asking things like:
- What dental insurance do you accept at your Chicago and Skokie offices?
- How do I book an emergency appointment?
- Am I a good candidate for porcelain veneers or Invisalign?
- What’s the difference between a dental crown and a dental implant?
- What should I expect during my first visit as a new patient?

This approach makes it easier for prospective and current patients to get quick, reliable answers—freeing your team to focus on what they do best.

If this seems helpful, I’d be happy to show you how it could fit directly on your site—no technical effort required.  
Let me know if you’d like to chat further, and thanks again for raising the bar for patient care in Chicago and Skokie.

Warm regards,  
Zac
