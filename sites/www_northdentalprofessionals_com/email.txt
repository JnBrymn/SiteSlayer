Hi Dr. Chaiken,

I’m reaching out because I admire the warm, patient-centered approach you bring to North Dental Professionals in Chicago and Skokie. Your commitment to thorough care, comfort, and clear communication truly sets you apart.

I’m Zac from SlayDigital.ai, and we help practices like yours save staff time and improve patient experience by adding a simple, custom AI web agent—designed to answer common questions instantly, using only the information already on your site.

I put together a quick demo for you, using your own content: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_northdentalprofessionals_com  
You’ll see a chat icon in the bottom-right corner. Click it to open a chat box and ask any question a new or current patient might have. The agent handles answers based purely on your current site.

You can try asking things like:
- What insurance plans do you accept?
- How do I request an appointment in Skokie or Chicago?
- What should I do in a dental emergency?
- Do you offer Invisalign, and how does it work?
- What’s the process for getting dental implants?

If you think this could help your patients (and your team), I’d be happy to chat further or set up a live walk-through. Either way, thanks for all you do to make people comfortable and informed when it matters most.

Best,  
Zac
