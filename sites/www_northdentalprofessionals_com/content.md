[Home](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/) » Dental Services

# Dental Services Chicago & Skokie, IL

At both our [Chicago](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/our-dentist-office/chicago/) and [Skokie](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/our-dentist-office/skokie/) locations, our top specialists work toward achieving the same goal: to provide dental services that offer a new standard of excellence. Our team consists of general dentists as well as those trained in orthodontics, periodontics, oral surgery, restorative dentistry, and other specializations. Using a conservative approach, our dentists provide comprehensive services that focus on preserving your natural teeth and promoting your comfort and relaxation.

## Providing You With Expert Level Care

With our advanced technology, knowledge, and expertise, our team provides dental services that range from regular dental exams and teeth whitening to dental veneers, extractions, surgery, and so much more. We believe in being your partner in oral health, and we’ll work with you one-on-one to create the right treatment plan for you to help you achieve your best smile.

We invite you to call our office to set up a consultation with Dr. Paul Chaiken and learn more about comprehensive dental care in Chicago and Skokie, Illinois. Our team looks forward to helping you care for your smile!

## General Dental Services

At North Dental Professionals, we offer a range of [general dental services](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/dental-services/general-dentistry/) to maintain your oral health. Regular check-ups are essential to catch any potential issues early. During these visits, Dr. Chaiken will examine your teeth and gums to ensure they remain healthy. We also provide thorough cleanings to remove plaque and tartar buildup, which helps prevent cavities and gum disease. Our X-ray technology allows us to see what is happening beneath the surface, ensuring that no dental problem goes unnoticed.

We understand that your smile is not just about aesthetics but also a vital indicator of your overall well-being. That’s why we are proud to offer comprehensive oral cancer screenings as a crucial part of our dental services for those in the Chicago and Skokie, Illinois, area. Our dedicated team of dental professionals is committed to early detection and proactive care to ensure your oral health remains in the best possible condition.

### Oral Health Education

We believe that education is key to maintaining good oral health. Dr. Chaiken and his team provide valuable information on the importance of oral hygiene. Brushing and flossing regularly can prevent many common dental problems. We also offer dietary recommendations. Eating a balanced diet with limited sugary foods and drinks helps keep your teeth and gums healthy.

### Emergency Dental Care

[Dental emergencies](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/dental-services/general-dentistry/emergency-dentistry/) can happen at any time, and it is important to address them quickly. Whether you are experiencing a severe toothache or have a broken tooth, Dr. Chaiken and his team are here to help. We provide prompt and effective emergency dental care to relieve pain and restore your dental health.

### Our Oral Cancer Screenings

Oral cancer can manifest in various forms, and its early detection is vital for successful treatment. Our comprehensive approach involves a thorough examination of your oral cavity, including the lips, tongue, cheeks, gums, and throat. We pay attention to even the smallest details, leaving no stone unturned to ensure a comprehensive assessment of your oral health.

Our friendly and compassionate team will take the time to understand your medical history, lifestyle factors, and any potential risk factors associated with oral cancer. We believe in open communication and encourage you to ask questions. This makes sure you are well-informed and comfortable throughout the process. The screening technology we use allows our dentists and team to diagnose oral cancer in the earliest possible stages. This allows you to receive the care you need to regain your oral and overall health.

We urge you to schedule an appointment for an oral cancer screening to ensure the ongoing health and vitality of your smile. Early detection can save lives, and our dedicated team is here to support you every step of the way.

## Patient Review

I have written reviews before but there can't be enough said or enough praise given to Dr. Chaiken and his staff. They are thoughtful, compassionate, SMART, conservative in approach to maintaining care of original teeth. This is not a run-of-the-mill practice. Dr Chaiken and his team take great care of each patient and the overall well-being of every patient. They exceed in all categories of excellence, care, cutting edge technology and patient wellness. For myself and my family, overall patient wellness and individual care is the most important part of any physician. You can never go wrong in choosing North Dental Professionals.

Moira Dargis

## Cosmetic Dentistry

If you are looking to enhance your smile, our [cosmetic dentistry services](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/dental-services/cosmetic-dentistry/) can help. Teeth whitening is one of our most popular treatments. It can brighten your smile and boost your confidence. For those who need more extensive improvements, veneers are an excellent option. These thin shells are custom-made to cover the front surface of your teeth, giving you a flawless smile.

Misaligned teeth can affect your smile and your oral health. Our cosmetic services, including Invisalign, can help straighten your teeth. Invisalign offers a more discreet option with clear aligners that are easy to remove. Our team can give you the straight smile you desire.

## Restorative Procedures

Sometimes, teeth can become damaged or decayed. When this happens, our [restorative dental procedures](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/dental-services/restorative-dentistry/) can return your teeth to their natural function and appearance. Fillings are a common way to repair cavities. We use durable materials to fill in the gaps left by decay. If a tooth is more severely damaged, a crown may be necessary. Crowns are custom-made caps that cover the entire tooth, providing strength and protection.

## Schedule Our Services Today

Your oral health is our top priority at our dental offices. Dr. Paul Chaiken and his dedicated team are here to provide you with the highest-quality dental services. Do not wait to take care of your dental needs. Schedule your appointment with us today and take the first step towards a healthier, brighter smile.

Our skilled dentists may recommend these innovative clear aligners as a discreet orthodontic treatment that works to move your teeth into their ideal positions. These allow you to maintain a natural appearance throughout the course of treatment.

Our dentists can treat severe toothaches or tooth pain, replace a lost dental restoration, and fix cracked or fractured teeth. We can also provide restorative care for a chipped or broken tooth and even a partially or fully knocked-out tooth.

### Integrative Dental Medicine

Integrative dental medicine is a special approach to dental care that looks at how your oral health is connected to your overall health. Instead of just focusing on your teeth and gums, this treatment philosophy considers your whole body when creating a care plan.

Dr. Paul Chaiken may recommend integrative dental medicine if you are dealing with certain health issues related to your mouth and jaw. He often uses this approach to treat TMJ disorders, sleep apnea, and gum disease.

Integrative dental medicine aims to improve health in a safe, natural, and functional way. It may include advanced dental treatments, lifestyle changes, and working closely with other healthcare providers.

### Nikita T., Registered Dental Hygienist

Nikita was born in Kathmandu, Nepal, and relocated to the US in 2013. Coming from a place with limited access to dental care, she witnessed that people typically seek dental treatment only when they experience severe pain or emergencies. In doing so, when they went to see a dentist, it would be too late. This is also a reason why Nikita’s interest in preventative dentistry developed. One of Nikita’s life goals is to volunteer in underserved communities, including her own, and educate people about the importance of oral health, which significantly impacts overall well-being.

Graduating with honors from Malcolm X College in 2023, she is deeply passionate about oral health and dedicated to educating individuals to promote healthy smiles. Seeing patients improve their oral hygiene and witnessing their smiles transform overtime is truly rewarding. Creating a worry-free environment and ensuring that every patient feels heard are essential aspects of her approach.

During her spare time, Nikita enjoys going out with family, reading books, watching movies, cooking, and trying new dishes. She is fluent in Nepali and English, and having grown up watching Bollywood movies, she is also proficient in Hindi and Urdu.


### Jill P: Dental Assistant

Jill joined our team in 2011 but has been working in the dental field since 1993. She loves the relationships she has developed with our patients and focuses on ensuring that each person who visits us is comfortable and has a VIP experience.

Jill and her husband, Rob, have two Boston Terriers, Millie and Arlo. Outside the office, her hobbies include cooking, gardening, and collecting vinyl records.


### Tserena A., Dental Assistant

Tserena has been in the dental field for 17 years and has been a great dental assistant at Dental Friedstat Dental Associates for four 4 years. She is very knowledgable and is also certified in coronal polishing, scaling and certified in applying sealants.

Tserena has been a terrific addition to the office. Tserena lives with her husband and daughter in Glenview. In her spare time, she enjoys reading books, stitching, doing yoga, traveling, and spending time with friends and family.

# About Our Chicago and Skokie Dental Office Technology

North Dental Professionals features several advanced dental technologies to ensure that you receive only the highest quality of care. Our dentists and [team](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/our-dentist-office/meet-our-team/) combine years of experience with these technologies to create individualized treatment plans and help you receive your care in comfort. To schedule a consultation with [Dr. Paul Chaiken](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/our-dentist-office/paul-chaiken-dds/) and learn more about dental technology in Chicago and Skokie, Illinois, give us a call.

The dental technologies used in [our office](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/our-dentist-office/) include:


## Our Dedication to Technology

Our dentists and team are dedicated to continually providing you and your family with the highest available level of care. We are committed to meeting all of your dental needs and providing you with a dental experience that is comfortable and pleasant each time you visit us. To help us achieve these goals, we are pleased to offer the benefits of state-of-the-art dental technology. Dental technology includes a number of cutting-edge tools, equipment, techniques, and materials we use at our office to ensure you receive high-quality, gentle care. Our dentists and team have received the necessary training to utilize advanced dental technology to enhance your oral health.

We strive to use advanced dental technology to make your experience as efficient, comfortable, and enjoyable as possible. For example, our diagnostic equipment aids us in making quick, accurate diagnoses and helps us effectively plan your treatment. We strive to utilize the latest, most advanced technology available to provide you with the best possible experience and care every time you visit our office. Each of our different types of dental technology has its own benefits, and we invite you to continue browsing our website and contact our practice to learn more. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Dr. Paul Chaiken uses digital X-rays and photography to diagnose and treat dental problems more efficiently. The images captured by this device allow our dentists to more closely examine your teeth and oral structures before providing you with precise treatments to meet your needs. Call North Dental Professionals today to schedule an appointment and learn more about digital X-rays in Chicago and Skokie, Illinois.

### Benefits of Digital X-Rays

Digital X-rays are one of the advanced diagnostic tools we use to provide you with the best possible care. Digital radiography has changed the way we take dental X-rays by making the process faster, more comfortable, and more convenient than ever before. These X-rays use a digital sensor to take images of your teeth, unlike traditional X-rays that use film. Digital X-rays use significantly less radiation than conventional film X-rays and require the use of no chemicals for developing the images.

Our dentists can then instantly view the high-quality images on monitors right in the treatment room to provide you with efficient, accurate diagnoses and care. Our team is able to use digital radiography to identify and diagnose several types of dental problems, such as:

- Decay in between teeth
- Developmental abnormalities
- Improper tooth root positioning
- Cysts and abscesses
- Fractures in existing fillings
- Tumors
- Infection in the tooth nerves
- Bone loss

Digital dental X-rays are used to plan many kinds of dental treatment, such as oral surgery procedures, root canal treatment, dental implants, orthodontics, and more. To learn more about digital radiography and how we use X-rays at our office, we welcome you to call or visit us soon.

## Intraoral Cameras

Our dentists and team use an intraoral camera to access and view all areas of your mouth. This small imaging device helps us examine your entire mouth to diagnose and treat developing problems with greater ease. To schedule an appointment with Dr. Paul Chaiken and learn more about intraoral cameras in Chicago and Skokie, Illinois, call North Dental Professionals.

### Why Intraoral Cameras?

An intraoral camera is a tool we use to get a closer look at different parts of your smile. The intraoral camera is a small, pen-shaped device that we can use to take high-quality color photos of your teeth and gums, as well as other areas of your mouth, as needed. Because the intraoral camera is so small and easily maneuverable, we can use it to see angles in your mouth that we cannot easily view with the unaided eye.

We may utilize the intraoral camera to evaluate your oral health better and diagnose dental problems like tooth decay and periodontal disease, as well as tooth damage like a cracked or chipped tooth. The intraoral camera is also useful in following up after completing a treatment.

In addition to helping our team get a better view of your smile, the images taken with the intraoral camera allow you, our patient, to better understand your oral health and dental treatments. We can also send these photos to other dentists and specialists and can submit them to dental insurance companies as needed. To learn more about the uses and benefits of intraoral cameras, we invite you to call or visit our dentists and team soon.

## AI Radiological Precision

At North Dental Professionals, we utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the precision of radiological diagnostics. By analyzing X-rays and other imaging data with advanced algorithms, AI helps our dentists identify dental concerns quickly and accurately. This technology offers a research-based, data-driven approach to improve diagnostic accuracy and ensure no potential issues are overlooked. AI radiological tools are particularly helpful in detecting cavities, bone loss, and even early signs of oral disease that may be missed during a standard evaluation.

Incorporating AI into our diagnostic process helps us create more personalized treatment plans while providing peace of mind that your care is based on the most reliable and cutting-edge research.

## VELscope® Oral Cancer Screening

VELscope is an oral disease visualization device most frequently used to diagnose oral cancer. Like panoramic X-rays, CT scans, or ultrasounds, we use VELscope to capture images of your mouth. Like these imaging technologies, it is not intended to be a stand-alone diagnostic test.

Using these with standard oral exams provides significant visual information to our dentists regarding your oral health. Our dentists will see fluorescence patterns determined by your underlying physiological structure. Disruptions to these patterns may be an indicator of a lesion or other potential problem.

Most VELscope exams take about two minutes. Your examination process is both quick and comfortable. Our dentist, a hygienist, and your health care provider can perform a VELscope exam. VELscope works by shining blue light generated by light-emitting diodes into your mouth. It does not involve radiation, chemicals, rinses, dyes, or other harmful substances. However, we recommend that patients with a history of photosensitivity or who use photosensitive medications avoid light exposure from VELscope as a precaution.

If a VELscope shows a potentially cancerous lesion, our dentists should work with you to develop a treatment plan, including a referral to a specialist. This plan should include a biopsy to determine whether the lesion is cancerous and follow-up visits to monitor the progress of your treatment.

## Optical Scanner for Digital Impressions

Say goodbye to the discomfort of traditional dental impressions! Our office uses an advanced optical scanner to capture detailed digital impressions of your teeth and gums. This state-of-the-art tool uses a small, handheld device to take precise, 3D images of your mouth without using messy impression materials.

Digital impressions allow us to accurately design dental restorations like crowns, bridges, and clear aligners. The process is faster and more comfortable for you and ensures a better fit and more predictable results. Whether you’re restoring a damaged tooth or improving your smile, our optical scanner technology helps us provide efficient and highly effective care.

# Cosmetic Dentistry Chicago & Skokie, IL

Your smile speaks volumes about you, and at North Dental Professionals, we’re dedicated to helping you achieve a smile that radiates confidence. Our dental offices in [Chicago](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/our-dentist-office/chicago/) and [Skokie](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/our-dentist-office/skokie/), Illinois, offer cosmetic dentistry to improve the look of your smile. Our experienced dentists create personalized treatment plans based on your needs and goals. Cosmetic dentistry is just one part of the full dental care we provide to help you look and feel your best. Cosmetic treatments are part of our complete [dental services](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/dental-services/).

We use the latest technology, a strong understanding of cosmetic dentistry, and years of experience to give you the care you need to get the smile you’ve always wanted. North Dental Professionals offers a range of cosmetic dentistry services, including teeth whitening, veneers, and bonding, to help improve the appearance of your teeth.

## Addressing Smile Imperfections Through Cosmetic Dentistry

If you’re not happy with how your smile looks, cosmetic dentistry might be the answer. At North Dental Professionals, we offer treatments that can improve the appearance of your teeth and help you feel more confident when you smile. Whether you have minor flaws or more noticeable issues, we have solutions to help you love your smile again. Cosmetic dental care can treat:

- Cracked, chipped, fractured, or broken teeth
- Gaps and spaces between teeth
- Discolored, yellowed, or stained teeth
- Slightly misaligned or uneven teeth
- One or more missing teeth
- Teeth that appear too long, too short, or too pointed
- Very worn teeth
- Misshapen teeth

If any of these sound familiar, you’re not alone. The skilled team at North Dental Professionals is here to help you achieve the smile you’ve always wanted with care, experience, and modern cosmetic treatments.

## Our Range of Cosmetic Dental Services

Cosmetic dentistry encompasses a range of treatments designed to enhance the beauty of your smile. At North Dental Professionals, our cosmetic dental services include:


Our experienced dentists will collaborate with you to select the most suitable cosmetic dental treatments based on your specific needs and desires. This personalized approach ensures that your treatment plan aligns with your smile goals, contributing to increased self-esteem and the confidence to smile brightly.

### Bonding

Dental bonding is a quick and easy way to improve the look of your teeth. Dr. Chaiken uses a tooth-colored resin material to repair chips, cracks, small gaps, or uneven edges. The resin is carefully shaped and polished so it blends in perfectly with your natural teeth. You can get bonding in one dental visit.


Invisalign is a modern way to straighten your teeth without the need for metal braces. This treatment uses clear, removable aligners that gently move your teeth into the right position over time. Invisalign is great for teens and adults who want a more comfortable and nearly invisible option for improving their smile. You can remove the aligners to eat, brush, and floss, making them a convenient and flexible choice.

### Teeth Whitening

One of the most popular cosmetic dental treatments is teeth whitening. At North Dental Professionals, we offer both in-office whitening and take-home whitening kits. In-office whitening provides immediate results with a professional-grade bleaching agent applied by Dr. Chaiken. For those who prefer convenience, take-home kits allow you to whiten your teeth in the comfort of your own home at your own pace.


Porcelain veneers are thin, custom-made shells that cover the front of your teeth. They’re a great way to fix teeth that are chipped, stained, misshapen, or have small gaps. During the procedure, Dr. Chaiken removes a small layer of enamel, takes an impression, and then places the veneer once it’s ready. Veneers look very natural and can give you a brighter, more even smile that lasts for many years.


I've been a patient of Dr. Chaiken's for over 25 years and only receive superior care from him and every member of his practice. He takes every step possible to ensure I have no pain and dental procedures are performed to perfection. I feel like part of the dental family here and I highly recommend Dr. Chaiken and his practice.

We also use intraoral cameras. These small cameras let us look closely at your teeth and gums.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Do you want to know more? We can help. Learn more with answers to common questions about cosmetic dentistry in our Chicago office.

### What is the most popular cosmetic dental treatment?

Teeth whitening is the most popular cosmetic dental treatment. Many people want a brighter smile, and whitening is a quick and simple way to remove stains from coffee, tea, soda, or smoking. Because our whitening options are safe, effective, and affordable, teeth whitening is one of the top choices for patients interested in cosmetic treatment.

### How soon will I see results from cosmetic dentistry?

This depends on the treatment. You can get results in just one day with professional teeth whitening treatment. Bonding and veneers have similar treatments, but it takes less time to get bonding. You can complete bonding treatment in one visit, while it can take two visits to get veneers.

Invisalign takes the longest, but your treatment time will vary based on your needs. Some patients can complete Invisalign within 6 months, and others can take several years.

### How long does cosmetic dentistry last?

The results of cosmetic dentistry can last for years, but it depends on the treatment and how well you care for your teeth. Veneers are very durable and can last 10 to 15 years with good brushing and regular dental visits. Bonding is less long-lasting, usually around 3 to 7 years, but it can be touched up or replaced.

Invisalign straightens your teeth permanently, though you’ll need to wear retainers to keep your smile in place. Professional teeth whitening can brighten your smile for several months to a few years, but touch-up treatments may be needed.

### Does it hurt to get cosmetic dental treatments?

Most cosmetic dental treatments cause little to no pain. Veneers and bonding usually require only a small amount of tooth preparation, and your dentist can numb the area to keep you comfortable. Invisalign uses clear aligners that may cause mild pressure at first, but this usually fades as your teeth adjust. Professional teeth whitening may cause temporary sensitivity, but it doesn’t damage your teeth. These treatments are designed to be safe, gentle, and comfortable.

### Can cosmetic dentistry improve my oral health?

Yes. Treatments like bonding, veneers, or crowns can protect and strengthen damaged teeth. Invisalign can straighten your teeth for a healthier bite. A properly aligned bite makes it easier to brush and floss, which helps prevent cavities and gum disease. So, while cosmetic dentistry focuses on appearance, it can also help keep your teeth and gums healthier in the long run.

### Is cosmetic dentistry for everyone?

Cosmetic dentistry can be a great option for many people, but it depends on your age and overall health. Teens and adults who have healthy teeth and gums are often good candidates for cosmetic treatments. We won’t recommend most cosmetic dentistry treatments for children because their mouths are still developing.

Our office also needs to treat problems like cavities, gum disease, or bite issues first. We’ll carefully evaluate your teeth and gums to recommend the best options for you.

### What cosmetic dental treatments can children get?

Children can have certain cosmetic dental treatments, but they are usually more limited than adults. Common options include dental bonding, which can fix small chips or gaps in teeth. Braces or Invisalign are also considered cosmetic because they straighten teeth and improve the smile, while also helping with oral health. We only recommend more advanced treatments, like veneers for adults, once the teeth and jaw have fully developed.

### Can I get a smile makeover?

Yes! If you have several cosmetic concerns, you may be a good candidate for a smile makeover. A smile makeover combines different cosmetic treatments to improve the look of your teeth and gums. For example, if your teeth are crooked and stained, Invisalign can be used to straighten them, while professional teeth whitening can brighten their color. Other treatments like veneers or bonding may also be added to repair chips, close gaps, or reshape teeth. Every smile makeover is customized to fit your needs and goals.

## Why Choose Invisalign?

Invisalign clear aligners are a great option for people who want to straighten their teeth without the noticeable metal brackets and wires of traditional braces. Instead, Invisalign uses a series of custom-made plastic aligners to gently move your teeth into place.

This innovative approach ensures that patients can maintain a natural appearance throughout their orthodontic journey. This is because the aligners are virtually invisible and entirely removable. Invisalign aligners can address the same orthodontic issues as conventional braces.

Our skilled dentists may recommend Invisalign treatment to fix:

- Crowded teeth
- Crooked teeth
- Gapped and spaced teeth
- Overbites, open bites, underbites, or crossbites

## Who is a Good Candidate for Invisalign?

Invisalign is a popular and effective way to straighten teeth, but it’s not the right choice for everyone. Here’s who might be a good fit for Invisalign treatment:

- People with Mild to Moderate Dental Issues: Invisalign can treat slightly crooked teeth, gaps, or bite issues. You may benefit from braces if you have severely misaligned teeth. We will not recommend Invisalign for patients with complex bite problems.
- Teens and Adults: Invisalign is designed for teens and adults. It’s most effective for people who have all their adult teeth and are ready to commit to wearing the aligners as directed. Younger kids with baby teeth or a mix of baby and adult teeth usually aren’t good candidates for Invisalign.
- Responsible Individuals: To get the best results with Invisalign, you need to wear the aligners for 20 to 22 hours a day. You should only take them out to eat, drink (except water), and brush your teeth. If you’re responsible enough to stick to this routine, Invisalign can work well for you.
- People Who Want a Discreet Option: Invisalign aligners are clear and fit snugly over your teeth. The aligners are almost invisible. If you want a more discreet way to straighten your teeth without the look of metal braces, Invisalign is a great choice.
- Those with Healthy Teeth and Gums: You should have healthy teeth and gums before starting Invisalign. If you have problems like gum disease or untreated cavities, we will treat these problems first. Then we can begin treatment.

## The Invisalign Process in Chicago, IL

When you choose North Dental Professionals for your Invisalign treatment, we’ll first check if Invisalign is right for you. We can treat problems like gum disease and cavities if needed.

Once you are healthy, we will create your custom aligners. First, we will take digital impressions of your teeth.

Our advanced technology designs each set to gradually shift your teeth into place. We send these impressions to a local dental lab. Once your aligners are complete, we will give you the first sets.

You’ll switch to a new set of aligners every two weeks to help your teeth move slowly and gently. During treatment, you’ll have regular check-ups with us to track your progress and make sure your smile is on track.

On average, the length of Invisalign treatment is 6 to 18 months. However, every patient is different. Your treatment may take longer or shorter based on your needs and whether or not you wear the aligners consistently.

## How to Care for Clear Aligners

You must maintain your aligners during Invisalign treatment to ensure the best outcome. To care for Invisalign aligners:

### Clean Them Daily

Rinse your aligners with lukewarm water every time you take them out. Brush them gently with a soft toothbrush and clear, unscented soap. Avoid toothpaste because it can scratch the plastic. Always brush and floss your teeth before you put your aligners back in. This keeps food particles from getting trapped, which could lead to cavities or bad breath.

### Soak Your Aligners

To keep them fresh, soak your aligners in Invisalign cleaning crystals. This helps remove bacteria and keeps them clear. The crystals also provide a deep clean.

### Avoid Hot Water

Never use hot water to clean or rinse your aligners. High heat can warp the plastic and cause them not to fit properly. Instead, use lukewarm water to keep the aligners the right shape.

### Avoid Food and Drink

Do not eat or drink anything other than water with Invisalign on your teeth. You must remove your aligners then clean your teeth and gums before you put the aligners back on your teeth. Food and beverages can stain your aligners and encourage bacterial growth.

### Keep Them Safe

When you’re not wearing your aligners, store them in their case. This helps prevent damage and keeps them from getting lost. Do not wrap your Invisalign aligners in a napkin or paper towel because you could throw them away!

## What are Retainers?

Retainers are custom-made dental devices that help keep your teeth in their new, straight position after you finish Invisalign treatment. When your Invisalign treatment is complete, your teeth may still shift back to their old spots over time. Wearing a retainer ensures your hard work and new smile lasts.

We often recommend removable retainers made of clear plastic or a combination of plastic and wire. You can take them out when you eat, brush, and floss. They’re easy to clean and comfortable to wear.

At first, you will need to wear your retainer constantly. After some time, you will only need to wear it at night. We will provide instructions specific to you.

## See if Invisalign Clear Aligners Are Right For You

Do you want orthodontic treatment that allows you to eat, brush, and floss while you go about your day? Invisalign aligners could be the right choice for you.

# Porcelain Veneers Chicago & Skokie, IL

At [North Dental Professionals](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/our-dentist-office/), Dr. Chaiken provides expert porcelain veneer services to patients in [Chicago](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/our-dentist-office/chicago/) and [Skokie](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/our-dentist-office/skokie/), IL, and [surrounding areas](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/our-dentist-office/areas-we-serve/). You can dramatically alter your smile with veneers.

[Our team](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/our-dentist-office/meet-our-team/) can discuss your needs and help you achieve your desired results. If you’re ready for a brand new smile, talk to Dr. Chaiken about porcelain veneers. He also provides additional [cosmetic dentistry](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/dental-services/cosmetic-dentistry/) services to new and existing patients.

## Porcelain Veneers in Chicago, IL

Porcelain veneers are thin shells of medical-grade ceramic that attach to the front surfaces of your teeth. These veneers are custom-made to match your teeth. They are a great option if you want to fix:

- Small gaps between teeth
- Misaligned teeth
- Chipped teeth
- Worn down teeth
- Slightly crooked teeth

You may be a good candidate for veneers if you have any of these problems.

### The Benefits of Porcelain Veneers

Porcelain veneers offer many great benefits for patients who want to improve their smile, including:

- Natural Look: One of the biggest advantages is that they can make your teeth look beautiful and natural. Veneers are thin shells that are custom-made to fit over the front of your teeth. They can cover up chips, cracks, stains, gaps, or teeth that are uneven, giving you a brighter and more even smile.
- Stain-Resistant: Another great benefit is that porcelain veneers are stain-resistant. That means they are less likely to get discolored from things like coffee, tea, red wine, or smoking. This helps your smile stay white and fresh-looking for a longer time.
- Last For Years: Thanks to modern dental technology, veneers are also very strong and long-lasting. Porcelain veneers can last for many years with proper care. This makes them a smart and durable choice for people who want to improve the way their smile looks.

### Are Veneers Right For You?

Porcelain veneers might be a good choice if you want to improve the way your teeth look. They can help if you have teeth that are chipped, stained, uneven, or have small gaps between them. Veneers are also great for people who want a whiter smile that looks natural.

You should have healthy teeth and gums before getting veneers. If you have cavities or gum disease, our dentist will need to treat those problems first.


So many good things to say about Dr. Chaiken and the North Dental Professional team. I wish I had found them years ago. Love how they send text reminders and are very quick to respond to you. Dr. Chaiken is very professional and always talks you through the procedure and he is a perfectionist with the talents of Leonardo da Vinci. What an artist!!! Thank you so much :).

## The Porcelain Veneers Procedure

The journey to a new smile with porcelain veneers begins with a consultation with Dr. Paul Chaiken at North Dental Professionals. During this visit, Dr. Chaiken will examine your teeth and discuss your goals. He will determine if porcelain veneers are the right solution for you.

### Tooth Preparation

If you and Dr. Chaiken decide to move forward, the next step is tooth preparation. This involves removing a small amount of enamel from the front surface of your teeth. Tooth preparation will ensure the veneers fit properly and look natural.

### Impressions

After tooth preparation, Dr. Chaiken will take digital impressions of your teeth. He sends these impressions to a dental lab where your custom veneers are created. Dr. Chaiken will provide you with temporary veneers to cover your teeth in the meantime.

### Veneer Placement and Bonding

Once your veneers are ready, you will return to our practice for the final placement. Dr. Chaiken will check the fit and color of the veneers to ensure they meet your expectations. The veneers are then bonded to your teeth using a special adhesive. A curing light is used to harden the adhesive, securing the veneers in place.

## Aftercare

Taking care of your porcelain veneers helps them last as long as possible. This includes brushing twice a day with a soft-bristle toothbrush and using non-abrasive toothpaste. Flossing daily is also important to maintain gum health and prevent decay around the veneers.

Certain foods and habits can damage your veneers. We recommend that you avoid eating hard foods like ice or hard candy. You should also avoid bad habits like nail-biting and using your teeth to open packages. These could chip or break your veneers.

Continue to make regular visits to North Dental Professionals for check-ups and cleanings. Dr. Chaiken will check the condition of your veneers and make any necessary adjustments. Cleaning by a professional helps to maintain both your veneers and teeth.


Many patients have questions about porcelain veneers. We want our patients to have all the information possible to make an informed decision. Read answers to popular questions about porcelain veneers in our Skokie and Chicago, IL, offices.

### How long do veneers last?

Porcelain veneers are designed to be durable and can last many years if cared for properly. On average, veneers can last between 10 and 15 years. You can keep your veneers looking good with an oral hygiene routine and regular dental check-ups.

### How long does it take to get veneers?

The total time to get veneers usually adds up to several hours spread over multiple visits. At your first visit, we’ll examine your teeth, discuss your goals, and prepare your teeth over one to two hours.

Then it takes 30 minutes or more to take your digital impressions. When we place your veneers, it can take 1 to 2 hours based on how many veneers you get. We want to fit, adjust, and bond the veneers.

### Can I eat and drink normally with veneers?

Yes, you can eat and drink normally with veneers. Once your veneers are placed, you can enjoy most of your favorite foods and drinks just like you did before. Veneers are strong and made to handle everyday chewing. But try not to bite into very hard foods like ice, hard candy, or popcorn kernels. You can chip or damage your veneers.

### Will veneers affect how I talk and eat?

No. At North Dental Professionals, we create custom veneers that are made to fit your teeth perfectly. Because they match the shape and size of your natural teeth, most patients adjust quickly and can speak and chew normally. There may be a short adjustment period, but custom veneers are designed to feel comfortable and natural in your mouth.

### Can I whiten my veneers?

No, the veneer materials won’t respond to the whitening agents in store-bought or in-office treatments. But veneers can lighten the appearance of dull or discolored teeth. If you have old veneers that have discolored over time, we can offer replacements. We can also recommend teeth whitening before you get veneers, so we can match your treated teeth with your new tooth color.

### Can you remove veneers?

Porcelain veneers can’t be removed without replacing them. Before we place your veneers, we remove a small amount of enamel from your teeth so the veneers can fit properly and look natural. Because veneers cover the front of your teeth permanently, taking them off would expose the prepared tooth underneath. If you want a different look in the future, we can craft new veneers can be made to replace the old ones.

### Can veneers fix crooked or uneven teeth?

Yes, veneers can help fix mildly crooked or uneven teeth. They cover the front surface of your teeth and make them look straighter and more even. But if your teeth are very crooked, we might suggest braces or Invisalign before getting veneers for the best results.

# Emergency Dentistry Chicago & Skokie, IL

Dental emergencies can happen at any time and often without warning. You need to seek immediate care whether you have a severe toothache or a knocked-out tooth. At [North Dental Professionals](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/) in [Chicago](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/our-dentist-office/chicago/) and [Skokie, IL](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/our-dentist-office/skokie/), we provide comprehensive emergency dental services. Emergency care is part of our [general dentistry](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/dental-services/general-dentistry/) services to maintain your oral health. [Our team](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/our-dentist-office/meet-our-team/) is dedicated to helping patients prevent and recover from emergency dental situations.

If you’re experiencing a dental emergency, we offer same-day emergency care and after-hours care to address your urgent dental needs. Our team of experienced emergency dentists can provide prompt and effective treatment for a range of dental emergencies, such as toothaches, broken teeth, and abscesses.

## Common Dental Emergencies

It can be hard for some patients to understand what is truly a dental emergency. We treat many different types of emergency dental situations. If you have any questions, you should contact our office immediately.

### Toothache

A toothache is a common dental problem. It may be caused by various issues such as cavities, infections, or gum disease. If you have a toothache, first rinse your mouth with warm water and use dental floss to remove any trapped food. Avoid using aspirin directly on the gum near the aching tooth, as it may burn the tissue. Then contact North Dental Professionals for an appointment as soon as possible.

### Chipped or Broken Tooth

You can break or chip a tooth when you eat hard foods, play sports, or have an accident. You want to save any pieces of the tooth, rinse your mouth with warm water, and apply a cold compress to reduce swelling. Depending on the severity, treatment options may include dental bonding, [dental crowns](/dental-services/restorative-dentistry/dental-crown/), or veneers. Our skilled team can provide the necessary repairs to restore your smile.

### Knocked-Out Tooth

A knocked-out tooth is a serious emergency that needs immediate attention. Carefully pick up the tooth by the crown, avoiding the root, and rinse it with water if dirty. Try to place the tooth back in its socket without forcing it. If this isn’t possible, store the tooth in a container of saliva. Keeping the tooth moist will increase your chance that we can reattach it in our office. Get to our Chicago or Skokie office within 30 minutes for the highest chance of saving the tooth. If we can’t reattach your tooth, we’ll recommend [dental implants](/dental-services/restorative-dentistry/dental-implants/).

### Loose or Broken Restoration

Call Dr. Paul Chaiken’s office right away if you have a loose or broken restoration, such as a filling, crown, or bridge. A damaged restoration can leave your tooth exposed, which may cause pain, sensitivity, or even infection if not treated quickly.

Try to avoid chewing on that side of your mouth to prevent further damage. If the restoration has completely come out, keep it in a safe place and bring it with you to your visit. Dr. Chaiken will carefully examine your tooth to see if the restoration can be repaired or if it needs to be replaced.

### Tooth Abscess

A tooth abscess is a painful infection that often causes swelling, throbbing pain, or even fever. If you think you have an abscess, call Dr. Paul Chaiken’s office right away for emergency care. Don’t try to pop or drain the abscess on your own, as this can make the infection worse.

You can rinse your mouth with warm salt water to help ease discomfort, but the infection won’t go away without professional treatment. Dr. Chaiken will examine your tooth, take X-rays if needed, and determine the best way to remove the infection. Treatment may include draining the abscess, prescribing antibiotics, or performing a root canal or extraction to protect your overall health. Acting quickly will help relieve your pain and stop the spread of infection.

## What to Do in a Dental Emergency

You want to stay calm if you have a dental emergency. Contact North Dental Professionals immediately for guidance and to schedule an emergency appointment. Our expert staff will provide instructions on managing pain and discomfort until you can be seen.

You can take over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen can help reduce pain and inflammation. Temporary solutions like dental cement or sugar-free gum can provide short-term relief for issues like lost fillings or crowns. The most important thing to do in a dental emergency is to avoid touching the painful area.

## How to Prevent Emergency Dental Problems

While most dental emergencies happen without warning, infections or abscesses can develop over time. You can also increase your risk of a dental emergency if you don’t wear a mouthguard during sports. The best way to avoid dental emergencies is to keep up with regular check-ups, practice good oral hygiene every day, and protect your smile.

### Visit Our Office Regularly

Routine visits to our office allow Dr. Chaiken and his team to examine your teeth and gums closely. During these visits, they can spot cavities, gum problems, or early signs of damage before they become painful or require more serious treatment. Preventive care like this saves you time, money, and discomfort in the long run.

### Brush and Floss

We recommend that you brush and floss every day. Brushing removes food and plaque from the surface of your teeth, while flossing cleans between teeth where a toothbrush cannot reach. When you make these habits part of your daily routine, you lower your risk of tooth decay, gum disease, and infections that could lead to emergency visits. You’re less likely to develop painful problems if you have healthy teeth and gums.

### Protect Your Teeth and Gums

If you play sports or take part in physical activities, a mouthguard is another important way to avoid emergencies. Contact sports, biking, or even recreational activities can sometimes lead to broken or knocked-out teeth. A mouthguard helps cushion your teeth and jaw against sudden impacts and reduce the risk of injury.

Even with good care, dental emergencies can still happen and need quick attention. But knowing the most common emergencies and how to handle them can help reduce stress and protect your teeth. At North Dental Professionals, we’re here to give you fast and high-quality emergency care. If you ever face a dental emergency, call us right away. Your oral health is our top concern, and we want to keep your smile healthy and strong.

# Restorative Dentistry Chicago & Skokie, IL

Restorative dentistry is a specific branch of dentistry that focuses on restoring the health and function of an individual’s smile following tooth damage, tooth decay, or tooth loss. As a treatment option, it can be life-changing. After all, your smile is something that affects your overall quality of life. In addition to restorative care, we offer a range of [dental services](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/dental-services/) to ensure your oral health needs are fully met.

While our goal here at [North Dental Professionals](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/) is to help you avoid dental problems through preventive care, our dentists may occasionally recommend a restorative treatment to help you regain a healthy smile after tooth damage or loss. Whatever your needs may be, you can count on the team at our [Chicago](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/our-dentist-office/chicago/) and [Skokie, Illinois](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/our-dentist-office/skokie/), dental offices to provide you with the expert care you need to feel confident in your smile again.

At North Dental Professionals, we provide a variety of restorative dentistry options, such as dental implants, crowns, and bridges, to help restore the function and appearance of your teeth.

## Our Restorative Dentistry Services

When you come to one of our locations for restorative dental care, our caring dentists will carefully examine your smile before providing you with the best possible recommendations for restoring it.

Dr. Chaiken always takes care that you will know exactly what will happen and why. Your comfort is important to them.

### Dental Crowns

Dental crowns are another popular restorative option. They cover a damaged tooth entirely. Crowns can be made from various materials, such as ceramic or metal. The process includes shaping the affected tooth and placing a custom-made crown over it. Crowns not only look like natural teeth but also provide strength and durability. They can be used to restore teeth that are severely decayed, cracked, or worn down.

Additionally, crowns are often placed after a root canal treatment to protect the tooth and prevent further damage. This comprehensive approach ensures that you can maintain a functional and aesthetically pleasing smile.

### Dental Bridges

Dental bridges are used to replace one or more missing teeth. They consist of artificial teeth anchored by crowns on adjacent teeth. This procedure is beneficial for restoring the function and appearance of your smile. Bridges can help you chew and speak more easily and prevent the shifting of nearby teeth. There are different types of bridges available, including traditional, cantilever, and Maryland bridges.

Dr. Chaiken will assess your specific needs and recommend the best option for you. The placement of a bridge usually requires two visits, during which impressions are taken, and the bridge is custom-made to fit your mouth perfectly.


For those seeking a long-term solution, dental implants are an excellent choice. Implants work by inserting a titanium post into the jawbone. This post acts as a replacement root. A crown is then placed on top. Implants look and feel like natural teeth. They also provide the most stable and durable option for tooth replacement.

Unlike other restorative options, implants help preserve the jawbone and prevent bone loss. The process involves several stages, including the surgical placement of the implant and a healing period before the crown is attached. While the procedure takes longer to complete, the results are long-lasting and provide a high level of satisfaction.

# Dental Implants Chicago & Skokie, IL

At [North Dental Professionals](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/our-dentist-office/), Dr. Paul Chaiken and his team provide high-quality dental care to the residents of Chicago and Skokie, IL. One of our key services is dental implants. Implants are a permanent solution for patients with missing teeth. They are an essential [restorative dentistry](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/dental-services/restorative-dentistry/) treatment that offers a lasting solution. With dental implants in Skokie and Chicago, we can help restore your smile for a lifetime.

## What Are Dental Implants?

Dental implants are titanium posts surgically placed into the jawbone beneath your gums. They act as sturdy bases for mounting replacement teeth. Unlike dentures or bridges, implants don’t slip or shift in your mouth. This stability helps improve your speech and appearance.

## The Benefits of Dental Implants

Dental implants have become the top solution for replacing missing teeth because they work so much like your natural teeth. While dentures and bridges can help, implants provide advantages that other options simply can’t match.

The common benefits of dental implant treatment in our Skokie, IL, office include:

### Look Natural

Dental implants are custom-made to blend perfectly with your smile. The crown (visible part) is shaped and colored to match your surrounding teeth so well that even you might forget it’s not real. Because implants fuse with your jawbone, they feel stable and comfortable. Unlike dentures, implants will not slip or click. You can laugh, talk, and smile without worrying about your teeth.

### Long-Lasting

With good care, your implants could last the rest of your life. While dentures typically need replacement every 5 to 8 years and bridges every 7 to 15 years, implants are designed to be permanent. The titanium post that acts as your new tooth root actually bonds with your jawbone to create an incredibly strong foundation.

### They Protect Your Oral Health

Missing teeth cause your jawbone to shrink over time, which can change your facial shape. Implants prevent this by stimulating bone growth just like natural tooth roots do. Unlike bridges that require grinding down adjacent teeth, implants leave your healthy teeth untouched. This helps maintain better long-term dental health.

### Restore Full Function

You can eat all your favorite foods without hesitation, even crunchy apples or chewy steak. Unlike dentures that can slip when eating or talking, implants stay securely in place. Many people find they can taste food better and speak more clearly with implants compared to other tooth replacements.

### Easy Care

You don’t need special cleaning solutions or adhesives. You care for implants just like your teeth. We recommend that you continue to brush, floss, and visit us for dental checkups after treatment. This simple routine helps ensure your implants stay clean, healthy, and problem-free for years to come.

## The Dental Implant Procedure

The journey begins with an initial consultation. Dr. Paul Chaiken will assess your oral health, take X-rays, and discuss your medical history. This evaluation helps determine if you are a suitable candidate for dental implants.

### Implant Surgery

Getting dental implants is a multi-step process that takes time but provides long-lasting results. It all starts with a consultation visit where Dr. Paul Chaiken will examine your mouth, take detailed X-rays, and review your overall health. This important first step helps determine if implants are the right solution for your missing teeth and ensures your jawbone can properly support them.

The actual implant procedure begins with placing a small titanium post into your jawbone where your tooth root used to be. You’ll receive local anesthesia so you won’t feel pain during this surgery, though you may feel some pressure.

### Healing

After we place the post, your body needs time to heal as the bone gradually grows around the implant in a natural process called osseointegration. This healing phase typically takes three to six months as your jawbone forms a strong bond with the implant.

Once your jaw has fully healed and the implant is secure, Dr. Chaiken will attach a connector piece called an abutment to the implant post. He will then take dental impressions.

### Final Restoration

The final step involves placing a custom-designed crown, bridge, or denture. We work with a dental lab to ensure your new teeth looks and functions just like teeth.

The lab makes the restoration to match your existing teeth in color and shape. We will guide you throughout the process and ensure you’re comfortable at each stage of your treatment.

## Aftercare with Dental Implants

Caring for your implants will make them last for many years. Just like your natural teeth, implants need daily brushing and flossing to stay clean and healthy. Use a toothbrush with soft bristles and gentle toothpaste to avoid scratching the surface of your implants.

Regular dental checkups at North Dental Professionals play a key role in maintaining your implants. During these visits, Dr. Chaiken will carefully examine your implants to ensure they remain secure and function properly. The professional cleanings you receive will remove any hardened plaque that regular brushing can’t eliminate to protect your implants and the surrounding gum tissue.


Had a very pleasant experience with Dr. Paul Chaiken. He's the consummate professional, informative, patient, thorough, knowledgeable, good natured and kind. Definitely a 10+ ! The staff are always courteous, thoughtful and Marina the hygienist is simply fantastic. She's the best I've had to date.

Do you want to learn more? We can help. Read answers to common questions about dental implants in Chicago and Skokie, IL.

### Am I a good candidate for dental implants?

Most healthy adults who have lost one or more teeth can get dental implants. You need enough bone in your jaw to support the implant and healthy gums. During your consultation, Dr. Chaiken will check your teeth, gums, and overall health to make sure dental implants are a good option for you.

### How do dental implants compare to traditional dentures and bridges?

Dental implants offer several advantages over [dentures](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/dental-services/restorative-dentistry/dentures-partials/). Implants are permanently fixed and do not need to be removed for cleaning. Dental implants also prevent bone loss, which is a common issue with dentures. Our implant restorations closely resemble natural teeth and offer the same function.

Unlike [dental bridges](https://www.northdentalprofessionals.com/dental-services/restorative-dentistry/dental-bridge/), which rely on surrounding teeth for support, we anchor implants into the jawbone. This independent structure helps preserve your adjacent teeth. Dental implants have a longer lifespan than bridges, which need replacement every 5 to 10 years.

### Can dental implants prevent bone loss?

Yes. When you lose a tooth, the bone that used to support it can start to shrink over time. This bone loss can change the shape of your face and even make your other teeth shift. A dental implant acts like a natural tooth root and sits securely in your jaw. It stimulates the bone just like a real tooth. Implants preserve your facial structure and also helps maintain the stability of your other teeth.

### How much bone do I need to get implants?

To get dental implants, you need enough jawbone to hold the implant securely. You need approximately 1mm of bone in height and width. The implant post might not stay stable if your bone is too thin or too soft.

During your consultation, Dr. Chaiken will take X-rays or scans to check your bone. If you don’t have enough bone, our oral surgeon can perform bone grafting to build up your jaw.

### How long does it take to get dental implants?

Everyone is different but dental implant treatment takes 3 to 12 months on average. Getting dental implants is a process that involves multiple steps and healing time. First, Dr. Chaiken will check your mouth and may recommend pretreatments. You may need weeks to heal after we treat gum disease, remove damaged teeth, or perform a bone graft if your jawbone isn’t strong enough.

Once your mouth is ready and we place your implants, your body needs time to heal. The bone slowly grows around the implant in a process called osseointegration, which usually takes 3 to 6 months. This helps make the implant strong and stable.

We place the abutment to connect the post to your new restoration. Your gums need time to heal several weeks. We’ll finally place your restoration once you’re healed.

### Does it hurt to get implants?

Our office works to make maxillofacial surgery as comfortable as possible. During surgery, we use local anesthesia so you won’t feel pain. We also offer sedation options for extra relaxation. You may feel some pressure or mild discomfort, but most patients say it is much easier than they expected.

You can experience some soreness or swelling directly after treatment. We can prescribe pain medicine and give you tips to reduce swelling as you heal.

### What is the cost and insurance coverage for dental implants?

The cost of dental implants can vary based on the number of implants needed and the complexity of the procedure. Many dental insurance plans cover only a portion of the cost. Our team at North Dental Professionals will help you navigate your insurance benefits. We can explore financing options to make the treatment more affordable.

### Are dental implants permanent?

Yes, dental implants are designed to be a permanent solution for missing teeth. The titanium post is placed into your jawbone, where it fuses with the bone. This creates a very strong and stable foundation, similar to a natural tooth root.

Because of this stability, dental implants don’t slip or move. Implant posts maintain your jawbone and facial structure.
