SUBJECT: Helping Patients Get Answers Faster at Richland Creek Family Dentistry

Hi Dr. McNutt and team,

I hope you’re having a great week at Richland Creek Family Dentistry. I was impressed by your focus on compassionate care and making both new and returning patients feel at home. Your commitment to clarity—especially for new patients and families—stood out to me.

I’m Zac Slay, founder of SlayDigital.ai. We create simple, custom AI chat agents that live right on your website and help visitors find key info in seconds, using only what’s already on your site.

To show how this could help, I’ve set up a quick demo of your site with our agent: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/richlandcreekdentistry_com. Just click the chat icon at the bottom-right—then type a question. The agent pulls answers directly from your existing content.

You can try asking things like:
- What insurance do you accept, and how does billing work?
- How does your in-office savings plan work for patients without insurance?
- What pediatric services do you offer for kids?
- How can I book an appointment, and what do I need to bring for my first visit?
- Is emergency dental care available for walk-ins?

The goal is to help your visitors get answers right away, reducing repetitive calls and making your team’s day a bit smoother—without adding complexity to your website.

If you’d like to discuss or have feedback, I’d love to hear from you. Either way, I hope the demo agent is useful as a quick resource.

Warm regards,  
Zac Slay
