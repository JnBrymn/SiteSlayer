Hi Dr. McNutt,

I’ve been browsing Richland Creek Family Dentistry’s site, and it’s clear how much you prioritize a welcoming, informative experience for both new and returning patients in Nashville.

I’m Zac, founder of SlayDigital.ai. We build simple, custom AI chat agents that live right on your website—letting visitors get quick, clear answers using the info you already provide. No technical hurdles for you or your staff, just less time spent on repetitive questions and a smoother path for new patients to schedule or understand their options.

I set up a quick demo for you:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/richlandcreekdentistry_com  
There’s a chat icon in the bottom-right—click it to open the chat box and try asking questions. The agent responds using your own website’s details.

You might try:
- What insurance plans do you accept, and do you offer an in-office savings plan?
- What should I expect on my first visit as a new patient?
- How do I request an emergency dental appointment?
- What pediatric dentistry services do you provide?
- What are your payment options and business hours?

If you think this could help free up your team and make things even easier for patients, let me know—I’d be happy to chat about a custom setup for your practice.

Best,  
Zac
