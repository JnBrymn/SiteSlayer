SUBJECT: A Simple Way to Help More Patients Get Answers on Your Website

-----------------------------------------

Hi Dr. McNutt,

I’ve been browsing Richland Creek Family Dentistry’s site, and it’s clear you and your team go above and beyond to make patients comfortable and informed. With so many dental services and options, it’s only natural that new and returning patients might have lots of questions—sometimes after hours.

At SlayDigital.ai, we build simple, custom AI web agents that let patients chat directly with the content on your website—getting instant, accurate answers without waiting for a callback.

To show how this works, I’ve set up a quick mock of your site with a demo agent here: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/richlandcreekdentistry_com. Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner to open the chat box, then type any question you might normally receive.

You can try asking things like:
- “What dental insurance do you accept?”  
- “How do I schedule an emergency visit?”  
- “What should I expect as a new patient?”  
- “Do you offer sedation options for anxious patients?”  
- “How much does teeth whitening cost?”

If you’d like to see what this could do for your real site—or have any questions—I’d be happy to chat further. No pressure, just thought it might help streamline things for you and your patients.

Best,
