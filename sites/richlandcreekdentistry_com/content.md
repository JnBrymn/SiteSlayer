General Dentistry | Richland Creek Family Dentistry


## General Dentistry

### General Dentistry

Helping our patients maintain a healthy mouth and smile is the main goal of general dentistry. We prefer to provide more minor, preventive care than to see patients suffer with more intensive treatments from a problem that was not managed in time. We want to ensure that your oral health is in its optimal state and positively contributing to the health of your entire body. We are here to brighten your smile and pave the way for a brighter life.

- [Root Canals](#rootcanals)
- [Extractions](#extractions)
- [Porcelain Crowns](#porcelaincrowns)
- [Bridges](#bridges)
- [Nitrous Oxide](#nitrousoxide)
- [Oral Conscious Sedation](#oralconscioussedation)

### Fillings

Composite fillings act as a dentistry solution for problems such as tooth decay or cracks. A composite filling is a tooth-colored plastic and glass mixture used to restore decayed teeth. This procedure is also utilized for cosmetic improvements of the smile by fixing any discoloration or reshaping any disfigured teeth.

[request an appointment](/appointments/)

### Root Canals

Root canals are needed when decay and bacteria spread for too long without treatment. At a certain point, this decay makes it to the pulp inside the tooth. This pulp includes nerves, therefore infection generally causes a lot of pain. Since this is happening on the inside of the tooth, you won’t necessarily see the damage. Instead, you could feel it through pain and notice other signs that include bleeding, swelling and bad breath.


### Extractions

An extraction is performed to remove a tooth, whether because of disease, crowding, or damage. When extractions are required, the area around the tooth will be numbed and your dentist will remove the tooth. A small amount of bleeding is normal, as your mouth will replace the removed tooth root by forming a blood clot in the area.


### Porcelain Crowns

Getting porcelain crowns is the best way to have a very natural looking smile. They are used when simply filling in a tooth is not an option. There are times when they decay is so bad that we just have to use a porcelain crown. We also use them with severely damaged teeth or teeth that have already had multiple fillings. Porcelain crowns are attached right to your teeth so that they can function, even when you bite something really hard! There are several types of porcelain crowns so it is important to discuss which type is best for you with your dentist.


### Bridges

When your teeth are missing, it greatly affects your smile. At the same time, the missing tooth has the potential to negatively affect your oral hygiene because of unprotected gum exposure. Dental bridges are one of many options aimed at improving the appearance and function of your teeth by replacing the missing tooth or teeth. During your exam, we will discuss whether or not dental bridges are right for you.


### Nitrous Oxide

Nitrous oxide is a very safe form of sedation. It is inhaled and the effects start within a few seconds. It can be adjusted quickly if a patient is too light or too deep. Also, after a few minutes without the gas, it is safe to drive home. It has very little side effects and hardly any effects on the kidneys, liver, brain, and more.

Nitrous oxide makes many people feel happy and warm. It causes a lot of people to laugh so it is often called laughing gas. It is great for sedation when a person is nervous at the dentist. It is also a great pain relief.

Not many dentists use nitrous oxide analgesia anymore. We would be glad to use it if you are extremely nervous or you need some pain relief during your procedure. Our goal is to keep you as relaxed as possible, no matter what procedure that we are performing.


### Oral Conscious Sedation

With oral conscious sedation, your anxiety will decrease and you’ll feel comfortable during your dental treatment. Rest assured, you will stay conscious throughout the procedure. With this type of sedation, we provide medication that relaxes your body and mind. If you undergo this type of sedation procedure, we ask that you have someone else drive you on the day of your treatment. Nonetheless, the effects of the sedation do not linger, so you will feel alert and back to your normal state again soon after treatment.

Preventive Dentistry | Richland Creek Family Dentistry


## Preventive Dentistry

You’ve no doubt heard it said that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. In dentistry, you might say it’s worth two pounds. Maybe even thousands of dollars. That’s because dental problems can become exponentially more expensive — and painful — the longer they go unaddressed. Fortunately, modern dentistry has many easy and relatively inexpensive ways to make sure that today’s minor annoyance does not turn into tomorrow’s major headache.

Preventive dentistry describes all the procedures used to arrest tooth decay and other diseases in the earliest stages. The goal is to keep you as healthy as possible and maintain your natural teeth for life.

## Preventive Dentistry Procedures

Preventive dentistry procedures range from the most basic services that have been used successfully for decades, to recent technological innovations. These procedures include:

- Cleanings. This is where dental health starts. There’s just no substitute for physically removing disease-causing dental plaque and calculus (tartar) from your teeth — especially in hard-to-reach areas near the gum line. That’s why regular professional cleanings are so important to your health.
- Dental Sealants. These invisible plastic coatings fill the tiny grooves in back teeth so they do not become havens for bacteria. They prevent cavities from forming and the need for fillings later on.
- Fluoride. This mineral is readily incorporated into the teeth’s mineral structure, thereby making them stronger and more decay-resistant. Fluoride can even reverse tiny cavities that are starting to form. If you are not getting enough from your toothpaste and drinking water, it can be applied directly to your teeth at the dental office.
- Laser Decay Diagnosis. Laser light can be used to detect early tooth decay quickly and easily, right in the dental office — before full-blown cavities form.
- Mouthguards. Athletic mouthguards are designed to absorb and distribute the forces of impact and minimize traumatic injury to both the hard and soft tissues of the mouth. In fact, an athlete is 60 times more likely to suffer harm to teeth when not wearing a mouthguard. The best ones are custom-made for you by your dentist.
- Oral Cancer Screenings. Your best chance of surviving oral cancer — a disease that affects not only lifelong smokers but also young non-smokers — is early detection and treatment. Oral cancer screenings are a routine part of every regular dental exam.
- Salivary Diagnostics. This is an exciting new development in the field of preventive dentistry. While it is in its infancy, it is already possible to detect the presence of certain diseases with a saliva test, and the technology is developing rapidly.
- X-Rays. For around a century, dentists have been using x-rays to reveal signs of disease not visible to the naked eye. Now, with CAT scans, they have become three-dimensional and are an indispensable tool to diagnose tooth decay, gum disease, bone density, bone volume and tumors.

## Your Role in Preventing Dental Disease

There’s one more extremely important component of preventive dentistry: you. The procedures mentioned above can only be effective if you come in to the dental office to take advantage of them. Likewise, the importance of maintaining a good oral hygiene routine at home cannot be overstated. Daily effective brushing and flossing will go a long way toward removing the dental plaque responsible for dental disease, tooth loss, and the need for more complex dental treatment.

Teeth Cleaning in Nashville, TN | Richland Creek Family Dentistry


## Teeth Cleaning in Nashville, TN

Regular brushing does not entirely prevent common oral issues like bad breath, dental plaque, tooth decay, tooth loss, or gum disease. That’s why you need professional teeth cleaning every six months to achieve optimum oral health.

During a professional dental cleaning, Richland Creek Family Dentistry deep cleans your teeth to eliminate stubborn tartar, bacteria, plaque, and stains — the common causes of dental problems like bad breath.

## Why Richland Creek Family Dentistry?

- We have a qualified team: Every dental specialist at Richland Creek Family Dentistry has the highest level of accreditation. That means our professionals are proficient in spotting and fixing minor to complex dental issues.

- We serve children and adults: Richland Creek Family Dentistry offers a comprehensive selection of deep cleaning services for adults and kids. Our child-friendly, comfortable atmosphere keeps young ones at ease during dental treatment.

## What do you Get During Professional Teeth Cleaning in Nashville, TN

### Examining Your Oral Cavity

In your first visit, our dental specialists conduct a comprehensive oral examination to identify issues that need attention. Typically, the specialist pays attention to ominous oral hygiene signs like:

- Tooth decay
- Gum disease
- Bad breath
- Dental plaque
- Stained teeth

### Deep Cleaning

After examination, our dental specialists scale your teeth to remove stubborn stains, tartar, and plaque from places where regular teeth cleanings using a brush could not reach. We use ultrasonic or sonic scales, which cause minimal discomfort.

### Dental Polishing

After the removal of plaque, our specialists polish your teeth to remove surface stains and extra dental plaque. The dental polishing procedure adds a sparkle to your teeth, giving you an attractive, healthy smile that boosts confidence.

## Book Your Professional Teeth Cleaning Service Now

Professional dental care is a priority for everyone who values oral hygiene. Dental treatment fights gum disease, bad breath, tooth loss, and tooth decay.

[Contact us](/contact) today to get an expert to clean the tartar, stains, and plaque deposits on your teeth.

Teeth Whitening in Nashville, TN | Richland Creek Family Dentistry


## Teeth Whitening in Nashville, TN

# Enjoy Exceptional Teeth Whitening Services in Nashville, TN

Discolored teeth indicate poor dental hygiene and can pose multiple health conditions. Richland Creek Family Dentistry understands this too well, that is the reason why we offer exceptional teeth whitening services.

## Why the Need for the Teeth Whitening Services?

Patients suffering from teeth discoloration from plaque, tartar, and other oral health concerns need teeth whitening. Moreover, one may need teeth whitening to avert the effects of aging. The tooth enamel becomes weaker with [age](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000951.htm) and may wear out, leading to discoloration.

Lastly, smoking and diet choices may result in teeth discoloration, hence the need for teeth whitening. Anyone with [sensitive teeth](https://www.verywellhealth.com/coping-with-teeth-whitening-sensitivity-1059409) should discuss this with the doctor before undergoing the whitening process.

### Who Can Benefit from Teeth Whitening?

Anyone can benefit from teeth whitening services. You qualify for the services if you suffer from discolored teeth. Kids can also benefit from teeth whitening services, but pediatric dentistry experts advise parents not to use bleaching products at home.

## Benefits of Teeth Whitening

Undergoing the teeth whitening process can positively impact your self-esteem by enhancing your smile. Teeth whitening will also result in a healthy mouth and improved overall health. During dental checkups, the dentist may also share oral care tips, which help minimize the risk of dental issues.

Almost everyone qualifies for teeth whitening services. If you suffer from teeth discoloration, visit Richland Creek Family Dentistry and enjoy a whiter smile.

### In-Office Light Whitening – The 101 Basics

In-office light teeth whitening is a sought-after procedure that eliminates stains and discoloration. It is highly effective and leaves teeth whiter and brighter. Light enhanced teeth whitening utilizes a blue light to whiten teeth resulting in a whiter smile and improved dental health.
