You’ve no doubt heard it said that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. In dentistry, you might say it’s worth two pounds. Maybe even thousands of dollars. That’s because dental problems can become exponentially more expensive — and painful — the longer they go unaddressed. Fortunately, modern dentistry has many easy and relatively inexpensive ways to make sure that today’s minor annoyance does not turn into tomorrow’s major headache.

Preventive dentistry describes all the procedures used to arrest tooth decay and other diseases in the earliest stages. The goal is to keep you as healthy as possible and maintain your natural teeth for life.

## Preventive Dentistry Procedures

Preventive dentistry procedures range from the most basic services that have been used successfully for decades, to recent technological innovations. These procedures include:

- **Cleanings**. This is where dental health starts. There’s just no substitute for physically removing disease-causing dental plaque and calculus (tartar) from your teeth — especially in hard-to-reach areas near the gum line. That’s why regular professional cleanings are so important to your health.
- **Dental Sealants**. These invisible plastic coatings fill the tiny grooves in back teeth so they do not become havens for bacteria. They prevent cavities from forming and the need for fillings later on.
- **Fluoride**. This mineral is readily incorporated into the teeth’s mineral structure, thereby making them stronger and more decay-resistant. Fluoride can even reverse tiny cavities that are starting to form. If you are not getting enough from your toothpaste and drinking water, it can be applied directly to your teeth at the dental office.
- **Laser Decay Diagnosis**. Laser light can be used to detect early tooth decay quickly and easily, right in the dental office — before full-blown cavities form.
- **Mouthguards**. Athletic mouthguards are designed to absorb and distribute the forces of impact and minimize traumatic injury to both the hard and soft tissues of the mouth. In fact, an athlete is 60 times more likely to suffer harm to teeth when not wearing a mouthguard. The best ones are custom-made for you by your dentist.
- **Oral Cancer Screenings**. Your best chance of surviving oral cancer — a disease that affects not only lifelong smokers but also young non-smokers — is early detection and treatment. Oral cancer screenings are a routine part of every regular dental exam.
- **Salivary Diagnostics**. This is an exciting new development in the field of preventive dentistry. While it is in its infancy, it is already possible to detect the presence of certain diseases with a saliva test, and the technology is developing rapidly.
- **X-Rays**. For around a century, dentists have been using x-rays to reveal signs of disease not visible to the naked eye. Now, with CAT scans, they have become three-dimensional and are an indispensable tool to diagnose tooth decay, gum disease, bone density, bone volume and tumors.

## Your Role in Preventing Dental Disease

There’s one more extremely important component of preventive dentistry: you. The procedures mentioned above can only be effective if you come in to the dental office to take advantage of them. Likewise, the importance of maintaining a good oral hygiene routine at home cannot be overstated. Daily effective brushing and flossing will go a long way toward removing the dental plaque responsible for dental disease, tooth loss, and the need for more complex dental treatment.

---

![Teeth Cleaning in Nashville, TN](/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Dental-Cleanings.jpg)

Regular brushing does not entirely prevent common oral issues like bad breath, dental plaque, tooth decay, tooth loss, or gum disease. That’s why you need professional teeth cleaning every six months to achieve optimum oral health.

During a professional dental cleaning, Richland Creek Family Dentistry deep cleans your teeth to eliminate stubborn tartar, bacteria, plaque, and stains — the common causes of dental problems like bad breath.

## **Why Richland Creek Family Dentistry?**

- We have a qualified team: Every dental specialist at Richland Creek Family Dentistry has the highest level of accreditation. That means our professionals are proficient in spotting and fixing minor to complex dental issues.
- We use the latest dental technology: Our dental facility serving Nashville, TN, uses modern dental technology like X-rays and digital imaging to keep your smile as clean as possible. What’s more? The experts undergo continuous education to stay updated on the latest dental inventions.
- We serve children and adults: Richland Creek Family Dentistry offers a comprehensive selection of deep cleaning services for adults and kids. Our child-friendly, comfortable atmosphere keeps young ones at ease during dental treatment.

## **What do you Get During Professional Teeth Cleaning in Nashville, TN**

### Examining Your Oral Cavity

In your first visit, our dental specialists conduct a comprehensive oral examination to identify issues that need attention. Typically, the specialist pays attention to ominous oral hygiene signs like:

- Tooth decay
- Gum disease
- Bad breath
- Dental plaque
- Stained teeth

### **Deep Cleaning**

After examination, our dental specialists scale your teeth to remove stubborn stains, tartar, and plaque from places where regular teeth cleanings using a brush could not reach. We use ultrasonic or sonic scales, which cause minimal discomfort.

### **Dental Polishing**

After the removal of plaque, our specialists polish your teeth to remove surface stains and extra dental plaque. The dental polishing procedure adds a sparkle to your teeth, giving you an attractive, healthy smile that boosts confidence.

## **Book Your Professional Teeth Cleaning Service Now**

Professional dental care is a priority for everyone who values oral hygiene. Dental treatment fights gum disease, bad breath, tooth loss, and tooth decay.

[Contact us](/contact) today to get an expert to clean the tartar, stains, and plaque deposits on your teeth.

# **Enjoy Exceptional Teeth Whitening Services in Nashville, TN**

Discolored teeth indicate poor dental hygiene and can pose multiple health conditions. Richland Creek Family Dentistry understands this too well, that is the reason why we offer exceptional teeth whitening services.

## **All About Richland Creek Family Dentistry**

Richland Creek Family Dentistry is a family-oriented practice that caters to the dental needs of kids and adults alike. We offer high-quality services in Nashville and neighboring areas like [Gallatin](https://www.gallatintn.gov/101/Things-to-Do), Nolensville, and SoBro.

We extend a wide range of services to help our clients maintain a brighter smile. These include;

- General dentistry
- Cosmetic dentistry
- Preventive dentistry
- Emergency care

Our preventive dentistry services incorporate [cleanings and teeth whitening](/preventive-dentistry) to help alleviate stains and tooth discoloration. Visit Richland Creek Family Dentistry for proper diagnosis by our skilled dentists.

## **Why the Need for the Teeth Whitening Services?**

**Patients suffering from teeth discoloration from plaque, tartar, and other oral health concerns need teeth whitening.** Moreover, one may need teeth whitening to avert the effects of aging. The tooth enamel becomes weaker with [age](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000951.htm) and may wear out, leading to discoloration.

Lastly, smoking and diet choices may result in teeth discoloration, hence the need for teeth whitening. Anyone with [sensitive teeth](https://www.verywellhealth.com/coping-with-teeth-whitening-sensitivity-1059409) should discuss this with the doctor before undergoing the whitening process.

### **Who Can Benefit from Teeth Whitening?**

Anyone can benefit from teeth whitening services. You qualify for the services if you suffer from discolored teeth. Kids can also benefit from teeth whitening services, but pediatric dentistry experts advise parents not to use bleaching products at home.

## **Benefits of Teeth Whitening**

**Undergoing the teeth whitening process can positively impact your self-esteem by enhancing your smile.** Teeth whitening will also result in a healthy mouth and improved overall health. During dental checkups, the dentist may also share oral care tips, which help minimize the risk of dental issues.

Almost everyone qualifies for teeth whitening services. If you suffer from teeth discoloration, visit Richland Creek Family Dentistry and enjoy a whiter smile.

### **In-Office Light Whitening – The 101 Basics**

In-office light teeth whitening is a sought-after procedure that eliminates stains and discoloration. **It is highly effective and leaves teeth whiter and brighter.** Light enhanced teeth whitening utilizes a blue light to whiten teeth resulting in a whiter smile and improved dental health.

## **Get Help from Richland Creek Dentistry!**
