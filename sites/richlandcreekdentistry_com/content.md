Emergencies can, and do, happen at any time. Being prepared and discussing emergency situations with your dentist is the best way to save valuable time and stress in the unfortunate situation of a dental emergency. Knowing what to do can be the difference between losing and saving a tooth. Always have your dentist’s number readily available in the case of an emergency.

You should always contact your dentist right away in an emergency situation. If you lose a permanent tooth, try to keep it moist while you get to the dentist. You can try placing it back in the socket if that is not painful, or between your cheek and gums. If that is not possible, placing it in milk can help improve the chances of saving the tooth.

If you crack a tooth or bite your tongue or lip, rinse your mouth with warm water and apply a cold compress to reduce swelling. For toothaches or objects stuck in your mouth, gently use floss to clean the area and remove any debris. Do not put aspirin on your teeth or gums and never use a sharp object on your teeth.

Wearing a mouthguard during physical activity will help protect your teeth. And avoid chewing foods like ice, popcorn kernels, or hard candy to reduce the chances of cracking a tooth. Also, refrain from cutting or tearing objects with your teeth.

If you have a dental emergency, contact us immediately.

### General Dentistry

Helping our patients maintain a healthy mouth and smile is the main goal of general dentistry. We prefer to provide more minor, preventive care than to see patients suffer with more intensive treatments from a problem that was not managed in time. We want to ensure that your oral health is in its optimal state and positively contributing to the health of your entire body. We are here to brighten your smile and pave the way for a brighter life.

![Fillings  Nashville, TN ](https://richlandcreekdentistry.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/fillings_img.jpg)

### Fillings

Composite fillings act as a dentistry solution for problems such as tooth decay or cracks. A composite filling is a tooth-colored plastic and glass mixture used to restore decayed teeth. This procedure is also utilized for cosmetic improvements of the smile by fixing any discoloration or reshaping any disfigured teeth.

 [request an appointment](/appointments/)

![Root Canals  Nashville, TN ](https://richlandcreekdentistry.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/rootcanals_img.jpg)

### Root Canals

Root canals are needed when decay and bacteria spread for too long without treatment. At a certain point, this decay makes it to the pulp inside the tooth. This pulp includes nerves, therefore infection generally causes a lot of pain. Since this is happening on the inside of the tooth, you won’t necessarily see the damage. Instead, you could feel it through pain and notice other signs that include bleeding, swelling and bad breath.

 [request an appointment](/appointments/)

![Extractions  Nashville, TN ](https://richlandcreekdentistry.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/extractions_img.jpg)

### Extractions

An extraction is performed to remove a tooth, whether because of disease, crowding, or damage. When extractions are required, the area around the tooth will be numbed and your dentist will remove the tooth. A small amount of bleeding is normal, as your mouth will replace the removed tooth root by forming a blood clot in the area.

 [request an appointment](/appointments/)

![Porcelain Crowns  Nashville, TN ](https://richlandcreekdentistry.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/porcelaincrowns_img.jpg)

### Porcelain Crowns

Getting porcelain crowns is the best way to have a very natural looking smile. They are used when simply filling in a tooth is not an option. There are times when they decay is so bad that we just have to use a porcelain crown. We also use them with severely damaged teeth or teeth that have already had multiple fillings. Porcelain crowns are attached right to your teeth so that they can function, even when you bite something really hard! There are several types of porcelain crowns so it is important to discuss which type is best for you with your dentist.

 [request an appointment](/appointments/)

![Bridges  Nashville, TN ](https://richlandcreekdentistry.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/bridges_img.jpg)

### Bridges

When your teeth are missing, it greatly affects your smile. At the same time, the missing tooth has the potential to negatively affect your oral hygiene because of unprotected gum exposure. Dental bridges are one of many options aimed at improving the appearance and function of your teeth by replacing the missing tooth or teeth. During your exam, we will discuss whether or not dental bridges are right for you.

 [request an appointment](/appointments/)

![Nitrous Oxide  Nashville, TN ](https://richlandcreekdentistry.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nitrousoxide_img.jpg)

### Nitrous Oxide

Nitrous oxide is a very safe form of sedation. It is inhaled and the effects start within a few seconds. It can be adjusted quickly if a patient is too light or too deep. Also, after a few minutes without the gas, it is safe to drive home. It has very little side effects and hardly any effects on the kidneys, liver, brain, and more.

Nitrous oxide makes many people feel happy and warm. It causes a lot of people to laugh so it is often called laughing gas. It is great for sedation when a person is nervous at the dentist. It is also a great pain relief.

Not many dentists use nitrous oxide analgesia anymore. We would be glad to use it if you are extremely nervous or you need some pain relief during your procedure. Our goal is to keep you as relaxed as possible, no matter what procedure that we are performing.

[request an appointment](/appointments/)

![Oral Conscious Sedation  Nashville, TN ](https://richlandcreekdentistry.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/oralconscioussedation_img.jpg)

### Oral Conscious Sedation

With oral conscious sedation, your anxiety will decrease and you’ll feel comfortable during your dental treatment. Rest assured, you will stay conscious throughout the procedure. With this type of sedation, we provide medication that relaxes your body and mind. If you undergo this type of sedation procedure, we ask that you have someone else drive you on the day of your treatment. Nonetheless, the effects of the sedation do not linger, so you will feel alert and back to your normal state again soon after treatment.

You’ve no doubt heard it said that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. In dentistry, you might say it’s worth two pounds. Maybe even thousands of dollars. That’s because dental problems can become exponentially more expensive — and painful — the longer they go unaddressed. Fortunately, modern dentistry has many easy and relatively inexpensive ways to make sure that today’s minor annoyance does not turn into tomorrow’s major headache.

Preventive dentistry describes all the procedures used to arrest tooth decay and other diseases in the earliest stages. The goal is to keep you as healthy as possible and maintain your natural teeth for life.

## Preventive Dentistry Procedures

Preventive dentistry procedures range from the most basic services that have been used successfully for decades, to recent technological innovations. These procedures include:

- **Cleanings**. This is where dental health starts. There’s just no substitute for physically removing disease-causing dental plaque and calculus (tartar) from your teeth — especially in hard-to-reach areas near the gum line. That’s why regular professional cleanings are so important to your health.
- **Dental Sealants**. These invisible plastic coatings fill the tiny grooves in back teeth so they do not become havens for bacteria. They prevent cavities from forming and the need for fillings later on.
- **Fluoride**. This mineral is readily incorporated into the teeth’s mineral structure, thereby making them stronger and more decay-resistant. Fluoride can even reverse tiny cavities that are starting to form. If you are not getting enough from your toothpaste and drinking water, it can be applied directly to your teeth at the dental office.
- **Laser Decay Diagnosis**. Laser light can be used to detect early tooth decay quickly and easily, right in the dental office — before full-blown cavities form.
- **Mouthguards**. Athletic mouthguards are designed to absorb and distribute the forces of impact and minimize traumatic injury to both the hard and soft tissues of the mouth. In fact, an athlete is 60 times more likely to suffer harm to teeth when not wearing a mouthguard. The best ones are custom-made for you by your dentist.
- **Oral Cancer Screenings**. Your best chance of surviving oral cancer — a disease that affects not only lifelong smokers but also young non-smokers — is early detection and treatment. Oral cancer screenings are a routine part of every regular dental exam.
- **Salivary Diagnostics**. This is an exciting new development in the field of preventive dentistry. While it is in its infancy, it is already possible to detect the presence of certain diseases with a saliva test, and the technology is developing rapidly.
- **X-Rays**. For around a century, dentists have been using x-rays to reveal signs of disease not visible to the naked eye. Now, with CAT scans, they have become three-dimensional and are an indispensable tool to diagnose tooth decay, gum disease, bone density, bone volume and tumors.

## Your Role in Preventing Dental Disease

There’s one more extremely important component of preventive dentistry: you. The procedures mentioned above can only be effective if you come in to the dental office to take advantage of them. Likewise, the importance of maintaining a good oral hygiene routine at home cannot be overstated. Daily effective brushing and flossing will go a long way toward removing the dental plaque responsible for dental disease, tooth loss, and the need for more complex dental treatment.

Regular brushing does not entirely prevent common oral issues like bad breath, dental plaque, tooth decay, tooth loss, or gum disease. That’s why you need professional teeth cleaning every six months to achieve optimum oral health.

During a professional dental cleaning, Richland Creek Family Dentistry deep cleans your teeth to eliminate stubborn tartar, bacteria, plaque, and stains — the common causes of dental problems like bad breath.

## **What do you Get During Professional Teeth Cleaning in Nashville, TN**

### Examining Your Oral Cavity

In your first visit, our dental specialists conduct a comprehensive oral examination to identify issues that need attention. Typically, the specialist pays attention to ominous oral hygiene signs like:

- Tooth decay
- Gum disease
- Bad breath
- Dental plaque
- Stained teeth

### **Deep Cleaning**

After examination, our dental specialists scale your teeth to remove stubborn stains, tartar, and plaque from places where regular teeth cleanings using a brush could not reach. We use ultrasonic or sonic scales, which cause minimal discomfort.

### **Dental Polishing**

After the removal of plaque, our specialists polish your teeth to remove surface stains and extra dental plaque. The dental polishing procedure adds a sparkle to your teeth, giving you an attractive, healthy smile that boosts confidence.
