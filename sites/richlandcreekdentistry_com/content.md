General Dentistry | Richland Creek Family Dentistry


## General Dentistry

### General Dentistry

Helping our patients maintain a healthy mouth and smile is the main goal of general dentistry. We prefer to provide more minor, preventive care than to see patients suffer with more intensive treatments from a problem that was not managed in time. We want to ensure that your oral health is in its optimal state and positively contributing to the health of your entire body. We are here to brighten your smile and pave the way for a brighter life.

- [Root Canals](#rootcanals)
- [Extractions](#extractions)
- [Porcelain Crowns](#porcelaincrowns)
- [Bridges](#bridges)
- [Nitrous Oxide](#nitrousoxide)
- [Oral Conscious Sedation](#oralconscioussedation)

### Fillings

Composite fillings act as a dentistry solution for problems such as tooth decay or cracks. A composite filling is a tooth-colored plastic and glass mixture used to restore decayed teeth. This procedure is also utilized for cosmetic improvements of the smile by fixing any discoloration or reshaping any disfigured teeth.

[request an appointment](/appointments/)

### Root Canals

Root canals are needed when decay and bacteria spread for too long without treatment. At a certain point, this decay makes it to the pulp inside the tooth. This pulp includes nerves, therefore infection generally causes a lot of pain. Since this is happening on the inside of the tooth, you won’t necessarily see the damage. Instead, you could feel it through pain and notice other signs that include bleeding, swelling and bad breath.


### Extractions

An extraction is performed to remove a tooth, whether because of disease, crowding, or damage. When extractions are required, the area around the tooth will be numbed and your dentist will remove the tooth. A small amount of bleeding is normal, as your mouth will replace the removed tooth root by forming a blood clot in the area.


### Porcelain Crowns

Getting porcelain crowns is the best way to have a very natural looking smile. They are used when simply filling in a tooth is not an option. There are times when they decay is so bad that we just have to use a porcelain crown. We also use them with severely damaged teeth or teeth that have already had multiple fillings. Porcelain crowns are attached right to your teeth so that they can function, even when you bite something really hard! There are several types of porcelain crowns so it is important to discuss which type is best for you with your dentist.


### Bridges

When your teeth are missing, it greatly affects your smile. At the same time, the missing tooth has the potential to negatively affect your oral hygiene because of unprotected gum exposure. Dental bridges are one of many options aimed at improving the appearance and function of your teeth by replacing the missing tooth or teeth. During your exam, we will discuss whether or not dental bridges are right for you.


### Nitrous Oxide

Nitrous oxide is a very safe form of sedation. It is inhaled and the effects start within a few seconds. It can be adjusted quickly if a patient is too light or too deep. Also, after a few minutes without the gas, it is safe to drive home. It has very little side effects and hardly any effects on the kidneys, liver, brain, and more.

Nitrous oxide makes many people feel happy and warm. It causes a lot of people to laugh so it is often called laughing gas. It is great for sedation when a person is nervous at the dentist. It is also a great pain relief.

Not many dentists use nitrous oxide analgesia anymore. We would be glad to use it if you are extremely nervous or you need some pain relief during your procedure. Our goal is to keep you as relaxed as possible, no matter what procedure that we are performing.


### Oral Conscious Sedation

With oral conscious sedation, your anxiety will decrease and you’ll feel comfortable during your dental treatment. Rest assured, you will stay conscious throughout the procedure. With this type of sedation, we provide medication that relaxes your body and mind. If you undergo this type of sedation procedure, we ask that you have someone else drive you on the day of your treatment. Nonetheless, the effects of the sedation do not linger, so you will feel alert and back to your normal state again soon after treatment.
