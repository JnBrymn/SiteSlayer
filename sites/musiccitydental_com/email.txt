SUBJECT: A Simpler Way to Answer Patient Questions on Music City Dental

Hi Dr. Spurlin and Team,

I appreciate how much care Music City Dental puts into making patients feel comfortable and informed from the very first visit. I noticed your priority on education, stress-free care, and flexible options like your in-office membership plan.

I’m Zac Slay, founder of SlayDigital.ai. We help practices like yours by building simple AI-powered chat agents that answer patient questions directly from your own website content. There’s no tech headache—just a clear way for visitors to get quick answers and feel at ease, right on your site.

I set up a live demo to show how this could work for you:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/musiccitydental_com  
Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner, type any question, and the agent will answer using the info already on your website.

You can try asking things like:
- What services do you offer for nervous patients?
- How does your Priority Care Membership Club work?
- Do you accept patients without dental insurance?
- What’s included in a new patient visit?
- What dental technologies do you use?

If this kind of tool could help make your patient experience even smoother, I’d be happy to chat about making it fit seamlessly with your site.

Warm regards,  
Zac Slay
