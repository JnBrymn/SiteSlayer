SUBJECT: A simple way to answer patient questions on your website

-----------------------------------------
Hi Dr. Spurlin-Moore,

I’ve been browsing Music City Dental’s site and was struck by the warmth, clarity, and care you bring to patient experiences—especially your focus on comfort for folks with dental anxiety.

I run SlayDigital.ai, where we build simple, custom AI chat agents that help website visitors get quick, accurate answers—from details about dental services to new patient logistics—based only on the information you already share online.

As a quick example, I’ve set up a mock demo of your website with an embedded chat agent:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/musiccitydental_com  
Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner to open the chat, then type any question you’d expect from a patient. The agent replies instantly with answers drawn from your existing site content.

You can try asking things like:
- What’s included in the Priority Care Membership Club?
- How do I schedule an appointment or access the new patient forms?
- What dental technologies do you use?
- When are you open, and do you have any Friday appointments?
- Do you accept patients without insurance?

Would you be interested in seeing how something like this could make your team’s day a little easier and help patients get the info they need right away?

Warm regards,  
Zac
