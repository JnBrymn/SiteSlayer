## Success Stories

Music City Dental is a Elite Environment. From the Warm welcome you receive from Mrs.Sherry to the nice and supportive staff. Dr.Terry is extremely caring and informative physician. She is through with her care plans for your teeth! The best dental practice I have been apart of in the last 12yrs.

Katavia F.

Everyone was extremely kind and helpful. I am very nervous at the dentist's office and the staff made my experience virtually stress free. I feel like I defiantly made the right choice in choosing my new dentist. Thank you very much for accepting me as a new patient. Special thanks to Sherrie. She really me me feel welcome

John G.

Music City Dental is the only dental office that I recommend to all my friends. As someone who had horrible experiences at the dentist when I was younger, I have huge anxiety about going to the dentist. I avoided going to the dentist for way too long which caused some extensive problems. However, from my very first visit to Music City Dental, I knew that this was the place for me.

Keosha W.

This my regular general dentist. I get my cleanings here and they are super great. Had 2 filling recently and it was super smooth. Zero pain, they explained everything to me as it was happening, so the communication was A+. Adi, who assisted my procedure was great, super friendly, casual, and informative. Prices are great, but ofc insurance is so murky your mileage may vary. Do recommend it here!

Arash S.

Beautiful, modern office. Friendly, knowledgeable staff. Exceptional, caring dentist. I am a retired dental hygienist who worked with Dr. Spurlin for several years when she was an associate in another practice. I was in a position to observe her genuine empathy and desire to provide the very best care for her patients. She has always been very professional and honest. Through the years I have seen work done by dozens of dentists. Hers is exceptional. That's why she is my dentist!

## Meet Dr. Terry Spurlin-Moore

Dr. Terry Spurlin dreamed of being a dentist after a heart-to-heart with her father at age six. He asked one day, while she was riding in the back seat of the family car, “What do you want to be when you grow up?” A young Terry told him, “I want to be a ballerina!” But, he challenged her saying, “You look like a doctor to me!”

Her goal is to create and maintain beautiful and healthy smiles for years of laughter and enjoyment while making all her patients feel like they are guests. Well respected by her peers and community, as a Nashville dentist she is passionate about creating a relaxing and nurturing environment that provides each patient with an individualized experience where they receive exceptional care and dental education. This approach enhances awareness and ability to ensure patients have a relationship with Nashville dentist Dr. Spurlin and her team.

## Our Team

## Dr. Terry Spurlin-Moore


In retrospect, Dr. Spurlin realized that was the exact moment that she thought of becoming a doctor. The support, care and planted seed of becoming one is owed – in large part – to her father. She also owes much of her internal drive to succeed, a constant interest in the healthcare profession and fascination with dentistry, and an overall desire to care for people to her father. As an inquisitive child, Dr. Spurlin realized that the early conversation with her father was the catalyst for her interest in science and laid the groundwork for her future career.

Dr. Spurlin completed her undergraduate studies at Michigan State University with a bachelor’s degree in anthropology with a pre-dental concentration. She also had the opportunity to further her studies in history and anthropology at the University of Ghana: Legon, West Africa before coming back to the United States to pursue and complete her degree in dentistry at Meharry Medical College. With the intent to be the best, she also completed her residency at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.


A very positive person, Nashville dentist Dr. Spurlin can always be caught with a smile on her face, especially after making a patient feel healthier and happier about their own smile.

### Adrian

Hello everyone! My name is Adrian! One of the reasons that I love being a dental assistant is because it allows me to make a real difference in patients’ lives by helping them maintain their oral health and comfort. The hands-on nature of the job keeps me engaged, and I enjoy working with a team to create a positive environment for our patients. Outside of work, I play the piano, which allows me to unwind and express my creativity in a different way.

Working at Music City Dental is particularly fulfilling because I get to meet new patients every day, hearing their unique stories and building relationships with them. It’s the perfect blend of healthcare and personal connection, and I couldn’t imagine doing anything else.

Testimonials | Music City Dental


## Testimonials

Music City Dental has been phenomenal with helping me on my teeth journey. The staff has been so professional in every aspect of my visits and made me feel as if I am part of the family. Also, if your looking to do Invisalign then consider Music City Dental.”

D. Dean

I am truly grateful to have found Music City Dental. Dr. Terry and her entire staff have always gone above and beyond for my wife and I. They provide excellent care, they prioritize our comfort, and always answer any questions we have about procedures. I have had multiple bad experiences and anxiety with other dentists in the past but now with MCD, I don’t worry at all. Thank you!”

A. Richards


The staff is amazing. From the receptionists at the front desk who remembered my name from the very first visit to the hygienists and dental assistants–everyone did their best to make me feel comfortable. Dr. Spurlin herself is kind and knowledgeable and always takes the time to make sure that I’m comfortable and calm. She didn’t make me feel guilty or ashamed about the work that I needed done but laid out a plan to help me get healthy.

I love Music City Dental and never plan to go anywhere else.”

K. Watkins

Nashville Dentist Testimonials – Read what patients and peers say about Dr. Spurlin and her team.

“This is the most professional and relaxing dentist I have ever been to. I usually have anxiety about going to the dentist, but not since I’ve started going here. I actually look forward to seeing the staff and Dr. Spurlin is awesome.”

C. Jennings

Frist the facility is beautiful and quaint…. Being new to Tennessee my search was very intentional and thought out because of past bad experiences with dentists…. I have always had dental anxiety but when I entered inside the karma I felt was an overwhelming calm, that I was not aware of initially, until my consultation with the doctor, (to my surprise) that’s my assurance I came to the right place…. The doctors and staff are very professional and beautiful people…. Dr Terry and Dr Mohammed they listened and heard my concerns, made recommendations over and beyond…. I highly recommend them all which make up the staff and doctors, I’m very pleased and trust I’m that person who is an advocate for my own health and well-being I listen and let it be known what’s for my good… I can go on and on this was my first visit, and I will gladly come back after I’ve been there for a while to see if all my expectations remain.. thank you Music City dentistry….. I love you guys already”

Z. Calhoun

“Worldclass service! Can’t find another practice that comes close to the level of expertise and professionalism I experience here.”


“Up to this point in my life I’ve only had the pleasure of dealing with military dentists, so walking into Dr. Spurlin’s office was a bit of a nice surprise. Before getting started, the dental tech showed me around the office. She then showed me to the consultation room where the doc had actually written me a card welcoming me to the “family”. They genuinely seemed to want to my business and cared about me as a flosser. Once we got started (after offering me a pillow and a blanket) Dr. Spurlin took the time to explain everything to me; what my options were, when to expect what– all in terms that I could understand. When I left, the scheduler looked at my insurance and explained to me everything on the treatment plan that would or would not be covered (I won’t be waiting another 8 years to to go a dentist again!!). On my way out I made an initial appointment for my wife – on a Saturday. Good place and the best dentist I’ve ever been to!”

Robb B.

This was by far the best dental experience I’ve ever had! From their convenient hours and relaxing environment, to the education and time they take to let you know exactly what’s going on with your treatment, Dr. Spurlin and her staff truly go above and beyond to make sure that you are comfortable and informed. I’ve finally found a dental practice that makes my comfort and needs a top priority.

Kris M.

Dr. Terry’s dental care is like another day in the mall. You leave with a smile and more confidence than when you walked in. She’s gentle and extremely sensitive of her patient’s needs.

Amber M.

Dr. Terry is compassionate and confident in her skills. She ensures each of her patients a sense of comfort while beginning and ending each visit with a smile.

Alma M.

Dr. Spurlin has been my dentist for several years and I have enjoyed the experience. From a person who avoids dentists and doctors she has made my experience informative and pleasant. She is very knowledgeable and very thorough with making sure you understand what is going on and what your options are.

Ursula H.

As a cardiologist who understands the link between heart disease and periodontal health, It is very important to me to have a dentist who is progressive and very knowledgeable. Dr. Spurlin is an excellent dentist and I trust her with all of my dental care.

Scott E. MD, Vanderbilt Cardiology
