## Success Stories

Previous

Music City Dental is a Elite Environment. From the Warm welcome you receive from Mrs.Sherry to the nice and supportive staff. Dr.Terry is extremely caring and informative physician. She is through with her care plans for your teeth! The best dental practice I have been apart of in the last 12yrs.

#### Katavia F.

Everyone was extremely kind and helpful. I am very nervous at the dentist's office and the staff made my experience virtually stress free. I feel like I defiantly made the right choice in choosing my new dentist. Thank you very much for accepting me as a new patient. Special thanks to Sherrie. She really me me feel welcome

#### John G.

Music City Dental is the only dental office that I recommend to all my friends. As someone who had horrible experiences at the dentist when I was younger, I have huge anxiety about going to the dentist. I avoided going to the dentist for way too long which caused some extensive problems. However, from my very first visit to Music City Dental, I knew that this was the place for me.

#### Keosha W.

This my regular general dentist. I get my cleanings here and they are super great. Had 2 filling recently and it was super smooth. Zero pain, they explained everything to me as it was happening, so the communication was A+. Adi, who assisted my procedure was great, super friendly, casual, and informative. Prices are great, but ofc insurance is so murky your mileage may vary. Do recommend it here!

#### Arash S.

Beautiful, modern office. Friendly, knowledgeable staff. Exceptional, caring dentist. I am a retired dental hygienist who worked with Dr. Spurlin for several years when she was an associate in another practice. I was in a position to observe her genuine empathy and desire to provide the very best care for her patients. She has always been very professional and honest. Through the years I have seen work done by dozens of dentists. Hers is exceptional. That's why she is my dentist!

## Meet Dr. Terry Spurlin-Moore

Dr. Terry Spurlin dreamed of being a dentist after a heart-to-heart with her father at age six. He asked one day, while she was riding in the back seat of the family car, “What do you want to be when you grow up?” A young Terry told him, “I want to be a ballerina!” But, he challenged her saying, “You look like a doctor to me!”

Her goal is to create and maintain beautiful and healthy smiles for years of laughter and enjoyment while making all her patients feel like they are guests. Well respected by her peers and community, as a Nashville dentist she is passionate about creating a relaxing and nurturing environment that provides each patient with an individualized experience where they receive exceptional care and dental education. This approach enhances awareness and ability to ensure patients have a relationship with Nashville dentist Dr. Spurlin and her team.

Of course our treatment rooms are disinfected between patients, as well.

## Dr. Terry Spurlin-Moore

Dr. Terry Spurlin dreamed of being a dentist after a heart-to-heart with her father at age six. He asked one day, while she was riding in the back seat of the family car, “What do you want to be when you grow up?” A young Terry told him, “I want to be a ballerina!” But, he challenged her saying, “You look like a doctor to me!”

In retrospect, Dr. Spurlin realized that was the exact moment that she thought of becoming a doctor. The support, care and planted seed of becoming one is owed – in large part – to her father. She also owes much of her internal drive to succeed, a constant interest in the healthcare profession and fascination with dentistry, and an overall desire to care for people to her father. As an inquisitive child, Dr. Spurlin realized that the early conversation with her father was the catalyst for her interest in science and laid the groundwork for her future career.

Dr. Spurlin completed her undergraduate studies at Michigan State University with a bachelor’s degree in anthropology with a pre-dental concentration. She also had the opportunity to further her studies in history and anthropology at the University of Ghana: Legon, West Africa before coming back to the United States to pursue and complete her degree in dentistry at Meharry Medical College. With the intent to be the best, she also completed her residency at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

Her goal is to create and maintain beautiful and healthy smiles for years of laughter and enjoyment while making all her patients feel like they are guests. Well respected by her peers and community, as a Nashville dentist she is passionate about creating a relaxing and nurturing environment that provides each patient with an individualized experience where they receive exceptional care and dental education. This approach enhances awareness and ability to ensure patients have a relationship with Nashville dentist Dr. Spurlin and her team.

A very positive person, Nashville dentist Dr. Spurlin can always be caught with a smile on her face, especially after making a patient feel healthier and happier about their own smile.

### Adrian

Hello everyone! My name is Adrian! One of the reasons that I love being a dental assistant is because it allows me to make a real difference in patients’ lives by helping them maintain their oral health and comfort. The hands-on nature of the job keeps me engaged, and I enjoy working with a team to create a positive environment for our patients. Outside of work, I play the piano, which allows me to unwind and express my creativity in a different way.

Working at Music City Dental is particularly fulfilling because I get to meet new patients every day, hearing their unique stories and building relationships with them. It’s the perfect blend of healthcare and personal connection, and I couldn’t imagine doing anything else.

Music City Dental has been phenomenal with helping me on my teeth journey. The staff has been so professional in every aspect of my visits and made me feel as if I am part of the family. Also, if your looking to do Invisalign then consider Music City Dental.”

**D. Dean**

I am truly grateful to have found Music City Dental. Dr. Terry and her entire staff have always gone above and beyond for my wife and I. They provide excellent care, they prioritize our comfort, and always answer any questions we have about procedures. I have had multiple bad experiences and anxiety with other dentists in the past but now with MCD, I don’t worry at all. Thank you!”

**A. Richards**

Music City Dental is the only dental office that I recommend to all my friends. As someone who had horrible experiences at the dentist when I was younger, I have huge anxiety about going to the dentist. I avoided going to the dentist for way too long which caused some extensive problems. However, from my very first visit to Music City Dental, I knew that this was the place for me.

The staff is amazing. From the receptionists at the front desk who remembered my name from the very first visit to the hygienists and dental assistants–everyone did their best to make me feel comfortable. Dr. Spurlin herself is kind and knowledgeable and always takes the time to make sure that I’m comfortable and calm. She didn’t make me feel guilty or ashamed about the work that I needed done but laid out a plan to help me get healthy.

I love Music City Dental and never plan to go anywhere else.”

“This is the most professional and relaxing dentist I have ever been to. I usually have anxiety about going to the dentist, but not since I’ve started going here. I actually look forward to seeing the staff and Dr. Spurlin is awesome.”

**C. Jennings**

Frist the facility is beautiful and quaint…. Being new to Tennessee my search was very intentional and thought out because of past bad experiences with dentists…. I have always had dental anxiety but when I entered inside the karma I felt was an overwhelming calm, that I was not aware of initially, until my consultation with the doctor, (to my surprise) that’s my assurance I came to the right place…. The doctors and staff are very professional and beautiful people…. Dr Terry and Dr Mohammed they listened and heard my concerns, made recommendations over and beyond…. I highly recommend them all which make up the staff and doctors, I’m very pleased and trust I’m that person who is an advocate for my own health and well-being I listen and let it be known what’s for my good… I can go on and on this was my first visit, and I will gladly come back after I’ve been there for a while to see if all my expectations remain.. thank you Music City dentistry….. I love you guys already”

**Z. Calhoun**

“Worldclass service! Can’t find another practice that comes close to the level of expertise and professionalism I experience here.”

**C. Jennings**

“Up to this point in my life I’ve only had the pleasure of dealing with military dentists, so walking into Dr. Spurlin’s office was a bit of a nice surprise. Before getting started, the dental tech showed me around the office. She then showed me to the consultation room where the doc had actually written me a card welcoming me to the “family”. They genuinely seemed to want to my business and cared about me as a flosser. Once we got started (after offering me a pillow and a blanket) Dr. Spurlin took the time to explain everything to me; what my options were, when to expect what– all in terms that I could understand. When I left, the scheduler looked at my insurance and explained to me everything on the treatment plan that would or would not be covered (I won’t be waiting another 8 years to to go a dentist again!!). On my way out I made an initial appointment for my wife – on a Saturday. Good place and the best dentist I’ve ever been to!”

**Robb B.**

---

This was by far the best dental experience I’ve ever had! From their convenient hours and relaxing environment, to the education and time they take to let you know exactly what’s going on with your treatment, Dr. Spurlin and her staff truly go above and beyond to make sure that you are comfortable and informed. I’ve finally found a dental practice that makes my comfort and needs a top priority.

**Kris M.**

Dr. Spurlin has been my dentist for several years and I have enjoyed the experience. From a person who avoids dentists and doctors she has made my experience informative and pleasant.

![Procedure Details](/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Dental-Cleanings-300x199.jpg)Browse through our vast selection of the Nashville dental procedures offered at Music City Dental.

**Bonding**

Bonding is performed to close spaces between your teeth, improve the appearance of tooth alignment, restore chipped areas, or for other cosmetic purposes. This can help you achieve a stunning smile. Bonding involves adhering a composite resin material matched to the color of your teeth. The composite resin material is placed on the tooth and hardened with a special curing light. Finally, the composite resin material is shaped and polished to a fabulous finish.

**Bridges**

A bridge is one option for filling the space created by a missing tooth. One or two artificial teeth are attached to the adjacent teeth on either side for support creating a “bridge.” The bridge replaces missing teeth, both functionally and cosmetically.

**Crowns**

A crown, also referred to as a cap, is used to entirely cover a damaged tooth. A crown not only strengthens a tooth, but it can dramatically improve a tooth’s appearance, shape and alignment. Crowns may be used to replace a large filling when there is little tooth structure remaining, restore a fractured tooth or protect a weak tooth from fracturing, or cover a tooth that has had root canal treatment.

**Dentures**

Dentures replace lost or missing teeth. A partial denture uses clasps or arms to hold on to your remaining teeth for stabilization. A full denture replaces all of your missing teeth and relies on suction, which forms between the surface of the denture and your gum tissue. Implants may be used to stabilize a denture.

**Extractions**

Good oral hygiene should always be practiced since the loss of a single tooth can have major impact upon your oral health and appearance. Although we encourage tooth loss prevention, there are times when the best treatment involves removing one or more teeth. For example, a tooth may need to be extracted under the following circumstances:

- Severe decay
- Advanced periodontal disease
- Infection or abscess
- Orthodontic correction
- Malpositioned teeth
- Fractured teeth or roots
- Impacted teeth

**Fillings**

When a tooth is damaged by decay, a filling can help restore the tooth to its proper function and shape. If you have a tooth that requires a filling, we will first removed the decay, clean the affected area, and then restore the tooth with tooth-colored filling material.

**Gum treatment**

Gum treatment is the treatment of active gum and jaw bone disease. Gum disease treatment can slow or stop the progression of gum disease. Since there are different stages of gum disease (from gingivitis to advance periodontitis), there are different levels of treatment. In some cases, the patient may be referred to a specialist.

**Night Guards**

Nightguards are recommended for patients to treat TMJ disorders and for those who clench or grind their teeth at night as a way to protect their teeth and bite. Mouthguards are made of soft plastic and are recommended to protect the jaw and teeth during physical activity and sports such as boxing, football, basketball, or other activities where your mouth may get hit. In addition, these guards protect the soft tissues of your tongue, lips and cheek lining.

**Root Canal**

Root canal treatment (also called endodontic therapy) is necessary when a cavity is allowed, through neglect, to reach all the way to the nerve inside the tooth. Sometimes deep restorations or trauma to a tooth may cause the nerve to be damaged and pain and infection can result. When the nerve is infected, it must be treated; it cannot heal on its own. While symptoms can include sensitivity to hot/cold or sweets, pain, swelling, pain to biting or pressure, and a bad taste in the mouth, sometimes no symptoms are present and the patient is unaware of the problem until the dental exam.

A root canal is performed to clean out the infected tooth pulp, and disinfect the canals of the tooth. The only other treatment would be to extract the tooth. Once the infection is resolved, the canal(s) are filled in to prevent any further infection. Usually a core build-up and crown is recommended for restoring a tooth that has root canal therapy.

**Sealants**

Sealants are proven to reduce cavities by up to 70% in children and adolescents. Sealants are a clear or white resin material designed to flow into and seal the deep grooves in the chewing surface of children’s teeth. This helps to prevent invasion by bacteria into these hard to clean areas. Sealants are inexpensive, painless, and easily applied without anesthesia.

**Veneers**

Veneers can restore or significantly enhance your beautiful smile. They may be used to brighten or whiten discolored teeth, to restore worn or chipped teeth, and make misaligned teeth appear straight. Also known as laminates, veneers involve the bonding of a thin covering usually porcelain, over the outside, visible portion of a front tooth for aesthetic purposes. Veneers are usually placed only on teeth that are visible when talking or smiling.

**Whitening**

Whiter, brighter teeth can give a more youthful appearance. Tooth whitening is an effective way to achieve this goal. It can be used on stained or discolored teeth or simply to enhance a dull smile. Our office offers in-office whitening, a procedure that can potentially whiten your teeth several shades in an hour. While your teeth are being whitened, you can relax in our massaging chairs and enjoy a television program.

**Wisdom Teeth**

Wisdom teeth, also known as third molars, often need to be removed or extracted. They start forming as early as age 14 and come into the mouth at about age 18 to 21 years. Oftentimes, wisdom teeth may come in crooked or at an angle and can cause crowding of adjacent teeth. They may also become impacted and remain under the gum and bone.

**Invisalign**  
Music City Dental is proud to offer Invisalign®. Invisalign® is a wonderful, modern alternative treatment to braces. You can straighten your teeth without installing metal in your mouth. Instead, we use plastic trays (also known as aligners) to move your teeth back into place. Each aligner is custom made to fit your mouth so you don’t have to worry about mouth irritation or anything else that traditional braces can cause.

![Dental Technologies](/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/X-Ray-300x200.jpg)**Digital X-Rays**  
In our office we use digital radiography which allows us to take x-rays using up to 90% less radiation than conventional film x-rays. Using this technology, we are able to take an x-ray of your mouth by using a small sensor which records the image of your teeth and sends it to a computer. The result is a highly detailed image of your mouth that can easily be enhanced to better diagnosis dental concerns and determine the very best treatment for each case.

**Intraoral Camera**  
Small cameras about the size of a pen, called intraoral cameras, are utilized to help see the condition of your teeth and gums. With this advanced technology we can zoom in on small diseased areas, cracks, worn metal fillings, and soft tissue lesions. The full-color images taken with the intraoral camera are sent to a computer screen so we can diagnose dental problems much earlier than with traditional dental technology. Because images are displayed on our screens, you will also be able to see areas being treated and are able to gain a better understanding of dental procedures. Those images may be used to enhance communication with specialists or provide additional documentation needed by insurance companies.

**Paperless Charting**  
In our effort to help our environment, we employ digital charting with the aid of a computer. This technology allows us to maintain your dental records electronically, and cuts down the unnecessary paperwork used with traditional paper charting. Digital charting standardizes the charting process so it is clear and easy to understand, and it enables us to provide on the most accurate and precise care to our patients. When needed, this method also allows us to quickly and securely share information with your other health care providers.

**Diagnodent (advanced caries detection system)**  
Sub-surface caries lesions can be extremely difficult to detect using an explorer, and the DIAGNOdent™ offers a perfect adjunct to the diagnostic arsenal. It is especially useful for pit and fissure areas – even when the outer tooth surface seems to be intact. It works quickly and reliably. The laser fluorescence detector within the DIAGNOdent pen is a precise method for identifying fissure caries.

**Itero Scanner**  
We are proud to offer an iTero 3D scanner. We take pride in providing modern, high quality care so you can have the smile you deserve. We are constantly updating our equipment in order to provide patients with state-of-the-art dental care.

One of our newest pieces of equipment is our iTero 3D scanner. It allows us to take images of your smile. We can also use it to show you the results you can get with Invisalign®.

**Mr. Thirsty patient comfort system**  
“The lightweight Mr. Thirsty® Comfort Kit is designed to improve patient comfort by keeping metal HVE valve and tubing mounted on the delivery unit.”
