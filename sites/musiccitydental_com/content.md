This my regular general dentist. I get my cleanings here and they are super great. Had 2 filling recently and it was super smooth. Zero pain, they explained everything to me as it was happening, so the communication was A+. Adi, who assisted my procedure was great, super friendly, casual, and informative. Prices are great, but ofc insurance is so murky your mileage may vary. Do recommend it here!

#### Arash S.

Beautiful, modern office. Friendly, knowledgeable staff. Exceptional, caring dentist. I am a retired dental hygienist who worked with Dr. Spurlin for several years when she was an associate in another practice. I was in a position to observe her genuine empathy and desire to provide the very best care for her patients. She has always been very professional and honest. Through the years I have seen work done by dozens of dentists. Hers is exceptional. That's why she is my dentist!

![](/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/X-Ray-300x200.jpg)**Digital X-Rays**  
In our office we use digital radiography which allows us to take x-rays using up to 90% less radiation than conventional film x-rays. Using this technology, we are able to take an x-ray of your mouth by using a small sensor which records the image of your teeth and sends it to a computer. The result is a highly detailed image of your mouth that can easily be enhanced to better diagnosis dental concerns and determine the very best treatment for each case.

**Intraoral Camera**  
Small cameras about the size of a pen, called intraoral cameras, are utilized to help see the condition of your teeth and gums. With this advanced technology we can zoom in on small diseased areas, cracks, worn metal fillings, and soft tissue lesions. The full-color images taken with the intraoral camera are sent to a computer screen so we can diagnose dental problems much earlier than with traditional dental technology. Because images are displayed on our screens, you will also be able to see areas being treated and are able to gain a better understanding of dental procedures. Those images may be used to enhance communication with specialists or provide additional documentation needed by insurance companies.

**Paperless Charting**  
In our effort to help our environment, we employ digital charting with the aid of a computer. This technology allows us to maintain your dental records electronically, and cuts down the unnecessary paperwork used with traditional paper charting. Digital charting standardizes the charting process so it is clear and easy to understand, and it enables us to provide on the most accurate and precise care to our patients. When needed, this method also allows us to quickly and securely share information with your other health care providers.

**Diagnodent (advanced caries detection system)**  
Sub-surface caries lesions can be extremely difficult to detect using an explorer, and the DIAGNOdent™ offers a perfect adjunct to the diagnostic arsenal. It is especially useful for pit and fissure areas – even when the outer tooth surface seems to be intact. It works quickly and reliably. The laser fluorescence detector within the DIAGNOdent pen is a precise method for identifying fissure caries.

**Itero Scanner**  
We are proud to offer an iTero 3D scanner. We take pride in providing modern, high quality care so you can have the smile you deserve. We are constantly updating our equipment in order to provide patients with state-of-the-art dental care.

One of our newest pieces of equipment is our iTero 3D scanner. It allows us to take images of your smile. We can also use it to show you the results you can get with Invisalign®.

**Mr. Thirsty patient comfort system**  
“The lightweight Mr. Thirsty® Comfort Kit is designed to improve patient comfort by keeping metal HVE valve and tubing mounted on the delivery unit.”

![](/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Dental-Cleanings-300x199.jpg)Browse through our vast selection of the Nashville dental procedures offered at Music City Dental.

**Bonding**

Bonding is performed to close spaces between your teeth, improve the appearance of tooth alignment, restore chipped areas, or for other cosmetic purposes. This can help you achieve a stunning smile. Bonding involves adhering a composite resin material matched to the color of your teeth. The composite resin material is placed on the tooth and hardened with a special curing light. Finally, the composite resin material is shaped and polished to a fabulous finish.

**Bridges**

A bridge is one option for filling the space created by a missing tooth. One or two artificial teeth are attached to the adjacent teeth on either side for support creating a “bridge.” The bridge replaces missing teeth, both functionally and cosmetically.

**Crowns**

A crown, also referred to as a cap, is used to entirely cover a damaged tooth. A crown not only strengthens a tooth, but it can dramatically improve a tooth’s appearance, shape and alignment. Crowns may be used to replace a large filling when there is little tooth structure remaining, restore a fractured tooth or protect a weak tooth from fracturing, or cover a tooth that has had root canal treatment.

**Dentures**

Dentures replace lost or missing teeth. A partial denture uses clasps or arms to hold on to your remaining teeth for stabilization. A full denture replaces all of your missing teeth and relies on suction, which forms between the surface of the denture and your gum tissue. Implants may be used to stabilize a denture.

**Extractions**

Good oral hygiene should always be practiced since the loss of a single tooth can have major impact upon your oral health and appearance. Although we encourage tooth loss prevention, there are times when the best treatment involves removing one or more teeth. For example, a tooth may need to be extracted under the following circumstances:

- Severe decay
- Advanced periodontal disease
- Infection or abscess
- Orthodontic correction
- Malpositioned teeth
- Fractured teeth or roots
- Impacted teeth

**Fillings**

When a tooth is damaged by decay, a filling can help restore the tooth to its proper function and shape. If you have a tooth that requires a filling, we will first removed the decay, clean the affected area, and then restore the tooth with tooth-colored filling material.

**Gum treatment**

Gum treatment is the treatment of active gum and jaw bone disease. Gum disease treatment can slow or stop the progression of gum disease. Since there are different stages of gum disease (from gingivitis to advance periodontitis), there are different levels of treatment. In some cases, the patient may be referred to a specialist.

**Night Guards**

Nightguards are recommended for patients to treat TMJ disorders and for those who clench or grind their teeth at night as a way to protect their teeth and bite. Mouthguards are made of soft plastic and are recommended to protect the jaw and teeth during physical activity and sports such as boxing, football, basketball, or other activities where your mouth may get hit. In addition, these guards protect the soft tissues of your tongue, lips and cheek lining.

**Root Canal**

Root canal treatment (also called endodontic therapy) is necessary when a cavity is allowed, through neglect, to reach all the way to the nerve inside the tooth. Sometimes deep restorations or trauma to a tooth may cause the nerve to be damaged and pain and infection can result. When the nerve is infected, it must be treated; it cannot heal on its own. While symptoms can include sensitivity to hot/cold or sweets, pain, swelling, pain to biting or pressure, and a bad taste in the mouth, sometimes no symptoms are present and the patient is unaware of the problem until the dental exam.

A root canal is performed to clean out the infected tooth pulp, and disinfect the canals of the tooth. The only other treatment would be to extract the tooth. Once the infection is resolved, the canal(s) are filled in to prevent any further infection. Usually a core build-up and crown is recommended for restoring a tooth that has root canal therapy.

It’s that joyous time of the year for parents...

## *As we celebrate Black History Month we wanted to share some information on the Nashville Sit-Ins and their importance to the civil rights movement.*

## *Dr. Terry Spurlin-Moore’s cousin Novella Page was one of the young people who protested through non-violence the racial segregation of Nashville.*

## *The following article goes into depth the events of that protest*

The Nashville Sit-Ins, which lasted from February 13 to May 10, 1960, were among the earliest non-violent direct action campaigns in the 1960s to end racial segregation in the South. They were the first campaigns to desegregate lunch counters in Nashville, Tennessee. The sit-in campaign was coordinated by the Nashville Student Movement and Nashville Christian Leadership Council, which was made up primarily of students from Fisk University, American Baptist Theological Seminary, and Tennessee State University. Diane Nash and John Lewis, who were both students at Fisk University, emerged as the major leaders of the local movement.

On February 13, 1960, twelve days after the Greensboro sit-ins occurred, local college students entered S.H. Kress, Woolworth’s, and McClellan stores at 12:40 p.m. in downtown Nashville. After making their purchases at the stores, the students sat-in at the lunch counters. Store owners initially refused to serve the students and closed the counters, claiming it was their “moral right” to determine whom they would or would not serve. The students continued the sit-ins over the next three months, expanding their targets to include lunch counters at the Greyhound and Trailways bus terminals, Grant’s Variety Store, Walgreens, and major Nashville department stores, Cain-Sloan and Harvey.
