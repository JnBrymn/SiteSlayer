SUBJECT: Quick way to help Mt Juliet Dental Group visitors get answers (demo inside)

Hi there,

I’m reaching out after visiting the Mt Juliet Dental Group website—your personalized approach and focus on patient comfort really stand out.

At SlayDigital.ai, we build simple, custom AI web agents that let visitors chat with your site’s content, helping them quickly find answers without waiting or searching through menus.

I’ve set up a quick mock of your website with a demo agent here: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_mtjulietdentalgroup_com. Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner—type any question, and the agent replies using info already on your site.

You can try asking things like:
- “What insurance plans do you accept?”
- “What does the $59 new patient special include?”
- “How do I book an emergency appointment?”
- “What are your business hours?”
- “Do you offer payment plans or financing?”

If you’re interested in making it even easier for patients to get answers—and lightening your team’s call/email load—I’d be glad to chat. Let me know if you’d like to see what this could look like for Mt Juliet Dental Group.

Best,
