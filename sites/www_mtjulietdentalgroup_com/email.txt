Hi Mt Juliet Dental Group team,

I’m reaching out because I love how clearly you explain your services and prioritize patient wellness—from the $59 new patient special to your focus on the Mouth-Body Connection®. As someone who’s spent time on dental sites, I know patients often have repeat questions, even when the info is right there.

At SlayDigital.ai, we build simple, custom AI chat agents that embed on your website and help visitors instantly find answers—using the details you’ve already shared online. No jargon, just clear and direct help for your patients.

I’ve put together a quick mock of your site with a working agent you can try:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_mtjulietdentalgroup_com  
Click the chat icon in the bottom-right to open the box and ask a question; the agent will reply using your site’s content.

You can try asking things like:
- What does the $59 new patient special include?
- Do you accept Delta Dental insurance?
- How do I pay my bill or access the patient portal?
- What is the OralFitnessCheck and how do I schedule it?
- What are your emergency dental hours?

If you’d like to see how this could help reduce calls and make the patient experience even smoother, just reply to this note—no pressure! Happy to chat if you have questions or want to see more.

Best,
Zac
