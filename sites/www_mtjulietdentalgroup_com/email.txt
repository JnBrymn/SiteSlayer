SUBJECT: Make it easier for patients to get the answers they need

-----------------------------------------
Hi Mt Juliet Dental Group team,

Your focus on friendly, individualized care really shines throughout your website. I noticed how many patient questions you answer directly—whether about services, payment options, or what to expect on a first visit.

I’m Zac, founder of SlayDigital.ai. We help practices like yours make it even easier for patients to find answers by adding a simple AI web agent—one that lets visitors chat directly with your site and get clear, helpful responses from your own content.

To show you how this works, I set up a demo using your website:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_mtjulietdentalgroup_com

Using the chat icon at the bottom right, anyone can click, open the box, and type a question—no technical know-how needed. The agent responds with information already available on your site.

You can try asking things like:
- What insurance plans do you accept?
- How do I use Smile Generation MyChart for billing or forms?
- Do you offer same-day or emergency appointments?
- What’s included in the $59 New Patient Special?
- What should I bring to my first visit?

This tool helps your team cut down on repetitive calls and emails, while giving patients the quick, friendly answers they expect from you.

If you’re interested in learning more or have questions, just let me know—I’m happy to chat about how this could fit your process.

Wishing you a great week,
Zac Slay
