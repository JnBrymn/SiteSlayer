[OUR TEAM](/meet-our-team/)


# Services

Comprehensive care in every dental visit. Your oral health and overall wellness is our priority, and we look forward to serving you with the highest quality of care.

Emergency Dentistry

We provide the care you need when you need it. Trust our expert team to provide immediate relief. Learn more about our Emergency Dentistry services and how we ensure your comfort and well-being at every step.

[More on Emergency](/dental-services/emergency-dentist/)

Teeth Cleaning

Essential for good oral hygiene, regular dental checkups are the most effective way to identify issues at their early stages, which prevents discomfort and saves both time and money.

[MORE ON TEETH CLEANING](/dental-services/teeth-cleaning/)

Dental Crowns

A dental crown restores a tooth’s shape, size, and strength. With CEREC® same-day crowns, a procedure that otherwise requires multiple visits, can be accomplished in just one.

[MORE ON CROWNS](/dental-services/dental-crowns/)

Dental Sealants

Dental sealants are a thin, protective coating that is painted onto the back teeth to protect them from cavities for years to come.

[MORE ON DENTAL SEALANTS](/dental-services/dental-sealants/)

X-rays and Imaging

Accurate diagnosis requires a complete understanding of your mouth, so we use the latest dental imaging technology available to detect issues such as gum disease, tumors, cysts, infections, and abscesses.

[MORE ON DENTAL X-RAYS/IMAGING](/dental-services/dental-x-rays-and-imaging/)

Dentures

Whether partial or complete, dentures fit securely over the gums to replace some or all of your missing natural teeth. This restoration improves the overall functionality of your smile.

[MORE ON DENTURES](/dental-services/dentures/)

Dental Fillings

From thorough assessment to gentle removal of decay and precise restoration, our skilled team is dedicated to preventing further decay and restoring the look and function of your teeth.

[MORE ON FILLINGS](/dental-services/dental-fillings/)

Fluoride Treatment

Fluoride is a natural mineral that strengthens your teeth enamel. A dentist can painlessly apply topical fluoride to the surface of your teeth to protect against decay.

[MORE ON FLUORIDE TREATMENT](/dental-services/fluoride-treatment/)

Dental Implants

Dental implants offer a permanent solution for missing teeth that look and feel natural. Crafted from surgical-grade Titanium, dental implants act as roots that fuse with your natural bone to provide a strong foundation.

[MORE ON IMPLANTS](/dental-services/dental-implants/)

Inlays and Onlays

Restore the chewing surface of a damaged or decayed tooth. Inlays and onlays are bonded directly to the tooth for lasting strength and restoration.

[MORE ON INLAYS AND ONLAYS](/dental-services/inlays-and-onlays/)

Mouth guard

Protect your smile with personalized and removable mouth guards. Whether engaging in contact sports, dealing with teeth grinding, or managing jaw disorders, our custom solutions ensure your smile stays safe and sound.

[MORE ON MOUTH GUARDS](/dental-services/mouth-guard/)

Oral Cancer Screenings

Detecting the signs of oral cancer is critical to early diagnosis and successful treatment. A five-minute oral cancer screening can make all the difference.

[MORE ON ORAL CANCER SCREENINGS](/dental-services/oral-cancer-screening/)

Periodontics

Gum disease, which can advance into periodontal disease, affects the gums and supporting structures of your teeth. Urgent treatment is crucial as periodontal disease poses significant risks to your oral health.

[MORE ON PERIODONTICS](/dental-services/periodontitis/)

Root Canal

Endodontic treatment, commonly known as a "root canal", is a procedure aimed at saving a severely injured, cracked, or decayed tooth when its pulp becomes inflamed or infected. If left untreated, this condition can lead to pain or a tooth abscess.

[MORE ON ROOT CANAL](/dental-services/root-canal/)

Scaling & Root Planing

Scaling and root planing, a dental procedure often recommended when there is evidence of advanced gum disease, aims to eliminate the accumulation of plaque and tartar both above and below the gumline.

[MORE ON SCALING AND ROOT PLANING](/dental-services/scaling-and-root-planing/)

Teeth Bonding

Experience a painless transformation with teeth bonding, a cosmetic dental procedure that involves applying a tooth-colored composite resin to cover minor gaps and imperfections for a beautiful and natural-looking new smile.

[MORE ON TEETH BONDING](/dental-services/teeth-bonding/)

Teeth Extractions

Protect your oral health and get relief from dental pain by having a damaged or decayed tooth safely and gently removed.

[MORE ON TOOTH EXTRACTIONS](/dental-services/teeth-extractions/)

Tooth Bridges

Anchored to your existing teeth, a custom dental bridge provides a natural-looking and functional replacement for missing teeth.

[MORE ON TOOTH BRIDGES](/dental-services/tooth-bridge/)

Veneers

A veneer improves the appearance of the visible front surface of a tooth by covering it with a wafer-thin, custom-made shell of tooth-colored porcelain.

[MORE ON VENEERS](/dental-services/veneers/)

Teeth Whitening

If you’re considering enhancing the brightness of your natural teeth, our skilled team is here to guide you. Before taking any action, let’s discuss the potential of the treatment for a personalized approach tailored to your needs and preferences.

[MORE ON TEETH WHITENING](/dental-services/teeth-whitening/)

Wisdom Teeth and Oral Surgery

Wisdom teeth, or third molars, are the final set of permanent teeth and are often the least necessary. Although the extraction of wisdom teeth is a widely recognized oral surgery, various circumstances may necessitate other types of oral surgery.

We gladly accept most dental insurance plans, including but not limited to:

•   Aetna
•   Ameritas
•   Anthem Blue Cross
•   Cigna
•   Delta
•   Guardian
•   MetLife

•   UCCI

Please call us for more details at [615-241-8023](tel:615-241-8023).

## How Dental Insurance Works

## Coverage Verification

Before your dental visit, our team will verify your insurance coverage by checking your plan details.

## Treatment Planning

Our benefit coordinator works with you to maximize your dental benefits and minimize your out-of-pocket cost.

## Claim Submission

After your dental treatment is complete, we submit a claim to your insurance provider on your behalf.

## Payment Processing

We will tell you upfront what your insurance plan will pay for and offer options for taking care of any remaining out-of-pocket balance.


## How PPO Dental Plans Work

A Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) is the most common form of dental insurance, offering members a network of participating dentists to choose from. Dentists in this network agree to lower fee schedules, resulting in greater cost savings for patients. PPO plans cover a percentage of treatment costs, typically paying 50% for major treatments like crowns and bridges, 80% for basic care like fillings, and up to 100% for preventative care such as exams and cleanings. These plans often have annual maximums ranging from $1,000 to $2,000 and assist with insurance billing.

## Understanding your HMO

Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), also known as capitated or prepaid insurance, is a type of dental insurance plan that requires patients to choose a primary care dentist from a network of providers. This primary care dentist coordinates all aspects of the patient’s dental care and referrals to specialists within the HMO network. HMO plans typically have lower premiums and fixed copayments for covered services, but patients have limited choices in selecting dentists outside the network. Additionally, HMO plans may require patients to obtain pre-authorization for certain treatments, and coverage for out-of-network care is usually not provided except in emergencies.

## Dental Insurance FAQs

Got questions? We have answers! Check out our FAQ section to learn everything you need to know about navigating dental insurance coverage.

[SEE All FAQS](/about-us/faqs/)

### What is optional treatment?

Treatment that is either not listed on your fee schedule or more than the minimum to restore the tooth back to its original function.

### What's a covered benefit?

Treatment that is recommended by a dentist, is listed on the fee schedule, and accepted under the terms of your group's plan.

### What's the difference between indemnity, PPO, HMO, & discount insurance plans?

Indemnity or Traditional Insurance reimburses members or dentists at the dentist's UCR (Usual, Customary & Reasonable fee). This allows the subscriber to go to any dental office without being limited to a panel.


Let’s work together to optimize your dental care while making the most of your insurance coverage. Contact our office today and let us take care of the rest – your smile is in good hands.
