## Dental Crowns FAQs

If you have any questions about dental crowns, we’ve got answers.

[SEE All FAQS](/about-us/faqs/)

### What is the process for getting a dental crown?

The dentist will start by numbing the tooth and the area around it to make sure you’re comfortable throughout the process. Next, your dentist will shape the damaged tooth to better support the crown and creates an impression. 

 

Here’s the exciting part: With our advanced, proven technology, we can provide same-day crowns! That means you can walk out with your new crown in just one appointment.

### How long do dental crowns last?

With proper care and maintenance, dental crowns can last from 5 to 15 years. The lifespan of a crown depends on factors such as the material used, the location of the tooth, and oral hygiene habits.

### Are dental crowns painful?

Generally, dental crown procedures are not painful, but involve some discomfort. Our team of dental professionals highly value your experience and ensure minimal discomfort.

## The Importance of Dental Fillings

Dental fillings are essential for restoring teeth that have been damaged by decay, cracks, or fractures. Without fillings, these issues can worsen over time, which can lead to further decay, infection, and even tooth loss. By filling cavities and repairing cracks, fillings help prevent the spread of decay and preserve the structural integrity of the tooth. Additionally, fillings restore the functionality of the tooth, allowing for comfortable chewing and speaking. With timely intervention and proper dental care, fillings can effectively address dental issues and maintain optimal oral health for the long term.

# Dental Implants in Mt Juliet, TN

Dental implants offer a stable, lasting solution for missing teeth that look and feel natural. Let’s fill in what’s missing.

[CALL 615-241-8023](tel:%20615-241-8023)

![Portrait of a smiling young woman at home.]()

## What are Dental Implants?

Dental implants are replacements for missing teeth that serve to look, feel, and function like natural teeth. Surgically placed into the jawbone, the implants and your bone gradually fuse together. This allows for the attachment of the replacement tooth such as crowns, bridges, or dentures.

## What are the Benefits?

Dental implants not only enhance your smile, but also contribute to the well-being of your oral and overall health. Missing teeth can lead to bone loss, changes in facial structure, and difficulties in speaking and chewing. Dental implants play a crucial role by preventing the shifting of teeth, reducing the risk of gum disease, and promoting proper alignment in the bite.

If you’re experiencing any of these symptoms, call today without delay. Our team is here to provide swift and effective care.

## Dental Implants FAQs

If you’re thinking about dental implants, you may have some concerns. Here we’ve addressed common questions.

[SEE All FAQS](/about-us/faqs/)

### What are dental implants, and how do they work?

Dental implants are artificial tooth roots made of titanium that are surgically placed into the jawbone. They provide a sturdy foundation for the customized replacement teeth to match the shape and color of the natural teeth.

### Who is a good candidate for dental implants?

The ideal candidate for dental implants has good overall health, enough bone in their jaw to support the implant, and shows no signs of gum disease. It is best to consult with your dentist to determine if dental implants are right for you.

### How long does the dental implant process take?

The procedure is a lengthy one. Although the process can vary depending on individual circumstances, it typically takes several months to complete. During the healing period, most patients may expect their dental implants to fully fuse to their jawbone within a few weeks to several months. Once this process is complete, an abutment is attached to the implant followed by the replacement tooth attached to the abutment.

### How long do dental implants last?

With proper care and maintenance, dental implants can last a lifetime. Dental implants must be treated like natural teeth: regular brushing, flossing, and dental checkups.

During your initial consultation, our experienced dental team will assess your oral health and discuss your goals and expectations for treatment. If veneers are determined to be the right option for you, we will create a customized treatment plan tailored to your unique needs and desired goals.

The veneer process typically involves three main steps and minimal discomfort. First, your dental team will prepare your teeth by removing a small amount of enamel to accommodate the veneers. Then, they will take impressions of your teeth to create custom-made veneers that fit perfectly. Finally, the veneers are bonded to the front surface of your teeth, instantly transforming your smile.

Mouth guards, also known as night guards, provide essential protection for those involved in activities prone to dental or facial injuries. Whether you’re hitting the field for football, shooting hoops in basketball, or skating on the ice in hockey, a mouth guard protects you against impact injuries. But it’s not just for athletes. If you grind or clench your teeth, struggle with TMJ disorders, or deal with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea, a custom-made mouth guard can offer you relief and added protection.

![dentist showing her patient information on a screen]()

## 4 Reasons for a Mouth Guard

## Protection During Contact Sports

Mouth guards shield teeth and jaws from impact injuries, reducing the risk of chipped, broken, or knocked-out teeth.

![Number Icon One]()

## Prevent Teeth Grinding

For individuals who grind or clench their teeth during sleep (bruxism), a custom-made mouth guard provides cushioning and protection.

## The Different Types of Mouth Guards

Mouth guards come in three main types, each offering varying levels of fit and protection.

**Stock mouth guards** are pre-formed and readily available at sporting goods stores, but they often provide a poor fit and minimal protection.

**Boil-and-bite mouth guards** are softened in boiling water and then molded to fit the wearer’s teeth.

**Custom-made mouth guards** are recommended for the highest level of fit and protection.

## What to Expect

The wisdom tooth removal process begins with a consultation where X-rays are taken to assess the position and condition of the wisdom teeth. Before the procedure, local or general anesthesia is administered to ensure comfort during the surgery. The oral surgeon or dentist then makes an incision in the gum tissue to access the tooth and removes the wisdom tooth carefully. After extraction, the area is cleaned, and stitches may be placed to promote healing.

We recommend you avoid eating or drinking anything for a few hours before the procedure, and arranging for someone to drive you home afterward.

Gum disease, also known as gingivitis, is a common condition characterized by inflammation of the gums. It typically starts with gingivitis, where the gums become swollen and may bleed easily. Without proper treatment, gingivitis can progress to periodontal disease, leading to gum recession, bone loss, and even tooth loss.

Gum disease treatment is a specialized dental service that aims to address the underlying causes, remove plaque and tartar buildup, reduce inflammation, and restore gum health. We provide comprehensive gum disease treatment services to help our patients achieve optimal gum health.

# Dental Sealants in Mt Juliet, TN

Simple, effective, and stronger protection. Dental sealants are a preventive dental treatment that can help protect your teeth from decay and cavities.

[CALL 615-241-8023](tel:%20615-241-8023)

![Dental Sealants]()

## What Are Dental Sealants?

Dental sealants are thin, protective coatings applied to the chewing surfaces of the molars and premolars. These surfaces often have deep grooves and pits where bacteria and food particles can accumulate, making them more susceptible to decay. Sealants act as a barrier to help prevent bacteria and acids from reaching the tooth enamel and causing cavities.


Sealants are a cost-effective way to prevent dental decay compared to treating cavities with fillings or other restorative treatments.

## What to Expect

When you come in for a dental sealant procedure, our skilled dental team will first thoroughly clean and dry the teeth to be sealed. Next, we’ll apply a special gel that helps the sealant adhere better. After rinsing and drying the teeth again, we’ll carefully paint the liquid sealant onto the chewing surfaces of the teeth. Using a special curing light, we’ll harden the sealant, creating a strong, protective barrier. Finally, we’ll check the sealants to ensure they’re properly bonded and provide instructions for maintaining them.

## What to Expect

At your teeth bonding appointment, your dentist will start with a consultation to understand your smile goals. The dentist will then prepare the tooth surface by roughening it slightly and applying a conditioning liquid to help the bonding material adhere. Next, a tooth-colored resin is applied, carefully sculpted into the desired shape, and then cured or hardened using a special dental light. Once the bonding material is set, the dentist will trim and polish it to blend seamlessly with your natural teeth.

We’ll then apply the fluoride solution to your teeth using a brush, tray, or swab, depending on chosen method. The fluoride will be left on your teeth for a few minutes to allow for absorption before being rinsed off. You may be advised to avoid eating or drinking for a short period after treatment to maximize its effectiveness.
