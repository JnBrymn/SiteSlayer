# Services

![Woman with smile looking in mirror](https://s7d9.scene7.com/is/image/pacificdentalservices/GP-Services-hero-woman-mirror?fmt=webp-alpha)

Comprehensive care in every dental visit. Your oral health and overall wellness is our priority, and we look forward to serving you with the highest quality of care.

Emergency Dentistry

We provide the care you need when you need it. Trust our expert team to provide immediate relief. Learn more about our Emergency Dentistry services and how we ensure your comfort and well-being at every step.

[More on Emergency](/dental-services/emergency-dentist/)

Teeth Cleaning

Essential for good oral hygiene, regular dental checkups are the most effective way to identify issues at their early stages, which prevents discomfort and saves both time and money.

[MORE ON TEETH CLEANING](/dental-services/teeth-cleaning/)

Dental Crowns

A dental crown restores a tooth’s shape, size, and strength. With CEREC® same-day crowns, a procedure that otherwise requires multiple visits, can be accomplished in just one.

[MORE ON CROWNS](/dental-services/dental-crowns/)

Dental Sealants

Dental sealants are a thin, protective coating that is painted onto the back teeth to protect them from cavities for years to come.

[MORE ON DENTAL SEALANTS](/dental-services/dental-sealants/)

X-rays and Imaging

Accurate diagnosis requires a complete understanding of your mouth, so we use the latest dental imaging technology available to detect issues such as gum disease, tumors, cysts, infections, and abscesses.

[MORE ON DENTAL X-RAYS/IMAGING](/dental-services/dental-x-rays-and-imaging/)

Dentures

Whether partial or complete, dentures fit securely over the gums to replace some or all of your missing natural teeth. This restoration improves the overall functionality of your smile.

[MORE ON DENTURES](/dental-services/dentures/)

Dental Fillings

From thorough assessment to gentle removal of decay and precise restoration, our skilled team is dedicated to preventing further decay and restoring the look and function of your teeth.

[MORE ON FILLINGS](/dental-services/dental-fillings/)

Fluoride Treatment

Fluoride is a natural mineral that strengthens your teeth enamel. A dentist can painlessly apply topical fluoride to the surface of your teeth to protect against decay.

[MORE ON FLUORIDE TREATMENT](/dental-services/fluoride-treatment/)

Dental Implants

Dental implants offer a permanent solution for missing teeth that look and feel natural. Crafted from surgical-grade Titanium, dental implants act as roots that fuse with your natural bone to provide a strong foundation.

[MORE ON IMPLANTS](/dental-services/dental-implants/)

Inlays and Onlays

Restore the chewing surface of a damaged or decayed tooth. Inlays and onlays are bonded directly to the tooth for lasting strength and restoration.

[MORE ON INLAYS AND ONLAYS](/dental-services/inlays-and-onlays/)

Mouth guard

Protect your smile with personalized and removable mouth guards. Whether engaging in contact sports, dealing with teeth grinding, or managing jaw disorders, our custom solutions ensure your smile stays safe and sound.

[MORE ON MOUTH GUARDS](/dental-services/mouth-guard/)

Oral Cancer Screenings

Detecting the signs of oral cancer is critical to early diagnosis and successful treatment. A five-minute oral cancer screening can make all the difference.

[MORE ON ORAL CANCER SCREENINGS](/dental-services/oral-cancer-screening/)

Periodontics

Gum disease, which can advance into periodontal disease, affects the gums and supporting structures of your teeth. Urgent treatment is crucial as periodontal disease poses significant risks to your oral health.

[MORE ON PERIODONTICS](/dental-services/periodontitis/)

Root Canal

Endodontic treatment, commonly known as a "root canal", is a procedure aimed at saving a severely injured, cracked, or decayed tooth when its pulp becomes inflamed or infected. If left untreated, this condition can lead to pain or a tooth abscess.

[MORE ON ROOT CANAL](/dental-services/root-canal/)

Scaling & Root Planing

Scaling and root planing, a dental procedure often recommended when there is evidence of advanced gum disease, aims to eliminate the accumulation of plaque and tartar both above and below the gumline.

[MORE ON SCALING AND ROOT PLANING](/dental-services/scaling-and-root-planing/)

Teeth Bonding

Experience a painless transformation with teeth bonding, a cosmetic dental procedure that involves applying a tooth-colored composite resin to cover minor gaps and imperfections for a beautiful and natural-looking new smile.

[MORE ON TEETH BONDING](/dental-services/teeth-bonding/)

Teeth Extractions

Protect your oral health and get relief from dental pain by having a damaged or decayed tooth safely and gently removed.

[MORE ON TOOTH EXTRACTIONS](/dental-services/teeth-extractions/)

Tooth Bridges

Anchored to your existing teeth, a custom dental bridge provides a natural-looking and functional replacement for missing teeth.

[MORE ON TOOTH BRIDGES](/dental-services/tooth-bridge/)

Veneers

A veneer improves the appearance of the visible front surface of a tooth by covering it with a wafer-thin, custom-made shell of tooth-colored porcelain.

[MORE ON VENEERS](/dental-services/veneers/)

Teeth Whitening

If you’re considering enhancing the brightness of your natural teeth, our skilled team is here to guide you. Before taking any action, let’s discuss the potential of the treatment for a personalized approach tailored to your needs and preferences.

[MORE ON TEETH WHITENING](/dental-services/teeth-whitening/)

Wisdom Teeth and Oral Surgery

Wisdom teeth, or third molars, are the final set of permanent teeth and are often the least necessary. Although the extraction of wisdom teeth is a widely recognized oral surgery, various circumstances may necessitate other types of oral surgery.

## Experience the Difference of Advanced, Proven Technology

**Online Patient Portal**

Empower your healthcare journey with Smile Generation MyChart. With the convenience of the online patient portal, you can schedule and manage appointments, access billing and payments, and communicate directly with your clinician – all at your fingertips. Experience the convenience of managing your healthcare seamlessly and efficiently.

[GET STARTED WITH MYCHART](/patient-portal/)

**Digital X-Rays**

Digital X-rays offer a clear advantage in early detection and preventive care. By utilizing advanced image analysis, your doctor can identify early signs of gum disease through subtle changes in bone levels. This proactive approach, combined with comparisons to past treatments, ensures precise and encouraging dental care tailored to your individual needs.

[LEARN MORE ABOUT X-RAYS](/dental-services/dental-x-rays-and-imaging/)

**Cone Beam Computed Tomography**

Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is an advanced, proven technology that provides more precise three-dimensional (3D) imaging for more accurate diagnosis and treatment of oral health conditions. 3D dental X-rays can uncover issues that may not be detectable with 2D X-rays. By making images easier to see, it’s helpful in gaining a better understanding of oral health conditions and suggested treatment.

[LEARN MORE ABOUT CBCT](/dental-services/dental-x-rays-and-imaging/cbct/)

**CEREC® CAD/CAM**

CEREC® CAD/CAM technology revolutionizes dentistry by allowing for the creation of crowns in just two hours. There’s no need for temporaries and a second visit. It’s a precise fit and the process is less invasive for a durable and natural-looking smile.

[DISCOVER CEREC® TECH](/dental-services/dental-crowns/cerec-cadcam/)

**Laser Bacterial Reduction**

Laser bacterial reduction is a specific technique that uses laser technology to target and reduce harmful bacteria in the mouth. By using concentrated light therapy, LBR effectively eliminates bacteria that can lead to gum disease and other oral infections. This allows the gums to reattach to the bone for a healthy, infection-free outcome.

[EXPLORE THE LASER DIFFERENCE](/dental-services/periodontitis/)

**IntraOral Camera**

An intraoral camera is an indispensable diagnostic and educational tool. The tiny video camera moves around inside of your mouth and generates a tooth-by-tooth video exam of your teeth. Using an intraoral camera allows patients to better understand their dental needs by seeing what the dentist sees and then having it explained.

Dentists in this network agree to lower fee schedules, resulting in greater cost savings for patients. PPO plans cover a percentage of treatment costs, typically paying 50% for major treatments like crowns and bridges, 80% for basic care like fillings, and up to 100% for preventative care such as exams and cleanings. These plans often have annual maximums ranging from $1,000 to $2,000 and assist with insurance billing.

## Understanding your HMO

Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), also known as capitated or prepaid insurance, is a type of dental insurance plan that requires patients to choose a primary care dentist from a network of providers. This primary care dentist coordinates all aspects of the patient’s dental care and referrals to specialists within the HMO network. HMO plans typically have lower premiums and fixed copayments for covered services, but patients have limited choices in selecting dentists outside the network. Additionally, HMO plans may require patients to obtain pre-authorization for certain treatments, and coverage for out-of-network care is usually not provided except in emergencies.

## Dental Insurance FAQs

Got questions? We have answers! Check out our FAQ section to learn everything you need to know about navigating dental insurance coverage.

[SEE All FAQS](/about-us/faqs/)

### What is optional treatment?

Treatment that is either not listed on your fee schedule or more than the minimum to restore the tooth back to its original function.

### What's a covered benefit?

Treatment that is recommended by a dentist, is listed on the fee schedule, and accepted under the terms of your group's plan.

### What's the difference between indemnity, PPO, HMO, & discount insurance plans?

Indemnity or Traditional Insurance reimburses members or dentists at the dentist's UCR (Usual, Customary & Reasonable fee). This allows the subscriber to go to any dental office without being limited to a panel.

![Smiling african guy in dentist chair looking with trust at his doctor, close up. Young African American Man Getting Teeth Treatment With Professional Stomatologist At Modern Clinic]()

## Your OralFitnessCheck® Explained

The OralFitnessCheck helps detect early signs of gum disease and other health risks by measuring an enzyme called aMMP-8. Elevated levels can signal bacterial buildup or inflammation, which may be linked to conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s.

How it works:

- Rinse for 30 seconds.
- Spit into a cup.
- See your results in minutes.

Your dental care provider will explain what the results mean for your overall health.

**Important:** For the most accurate results, avoid eating, drinking, or brushing your teeth for at least 30 minutes before your appointment.

![OralFitnessCheck]()

## Understand Scaling and Root Planing

During a regular cleaning, the focus is on removing plaque and tartar from the surfaces of your teeth and along the gumline. However, if you have signs of gum disease, a regular cleaning may not be sufficient to address the underlying problem.

That’s where scaling and root planing come in. These procedures involve carefully removing plaque, tartar, and bacteria from the surfaces of your teeth and below the gumline. This thorough cleaning helps to eliminate infection and inflammation, which allows your gums to heal and your oral health to improve.

Scaling and root planing may be recommended if you have mild to moderate gum disease or if you’re at risk of developing gum disease due to factors such as poor oral hygiene, smoking, diabetes or genetic predisposition.
