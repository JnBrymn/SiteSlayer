## What is the Mouth-Body Connection® ?

The Mouth-Body Connection® refers to the link between oral health and overall health, and the role that the harmful bacteria and inflammation in our mouths play in chronic, systemic disease. That’s why it’s time we talked about more than your teeth. Our office prioritizes your overall health as it relates to your oral health. When we care for your smile we’re also looking out for your entire self.
