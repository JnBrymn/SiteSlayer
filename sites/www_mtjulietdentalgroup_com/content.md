![Happy latin women laughing and hugging each other outdoor in the city - Millennial girls and friendship concept]()

## What is a Dental Filling?

Dental fillings are restorative materials used to repair teeth that have been damaged by decay, cracks, or fractures. By filling in the affected area, fillings restore the tooth’s structure, function, and aesthetics. They help prevent further decay, preserve the natural tooth, and promote long-term oral health.

 
Fillings vary in material and characteristics. Amalgam fillings, made from a mixture of metals, are durable and cost-effective but may not match the color of natural teeth. Composite resin offers a natural look but may not be as long-lasting as amalgam fillings. Ceramic and gold fillings offer excellent durability and asthma but are typically more expensive options.

![Dentist preparing to check patient with mirror]()

## The Dental Filling Procedure

## Examination

Your dentist will examine your teeth and may take X-rays to identify areas of decay or damage that require filling. They will discuss the treatment plan with you and answer any questions you may have.

![Number Icon One]()

## Tooth Preparation

The affected tooth is numbed with local anesthesia. The decayed or damaged portion of the tooth is removed using a dental drill or laser.

![Number Icon Two]()

## Filling Placement

Once the tooth is prepared, your dentist will fill the cavity with a suitable filling material. Common options include amalgam (silver-colored) or composite resin (tooth-colored) fillings.

![Number Icon Three]()

## Polishing

After the filling is placed, your dentist will make final adjustments to ensure proper bite alignment and comfort. The filling is then polished to smooth out any rough edges and blend seamlessly with the surrounding tooth structure.

![Number Icon Four]()

[CALL 615-241-8023](tel:%20615-241-8023)

> In the 24 to 64 age group, dental cavities affect **91% of adults.**

## The Importance of Dental Fillings

Dental fillings are essential for restoring teeth that have been damaged by decay, cracks, or fractures. Without fillings, these issues can worsen over time, which can lead to further decay, infection, and even tooth loss. By filling cavities and repairing cracks, fillings help prevent the spread of decay and preserve the structural integrity of the tooth. Additionally, fillings restore the functionality of the tooth, allowing for comfortable chewing and speaking. With timely intervention and proper dental care, fillings can effectively address dental issues and maintain optimal oral health for the long term.

Dental implants offer a stable, lasting solution for missing teeth that look and feel natural. Let’s fill in what’s missing.

[CALL 615-241-8023](tel:%20615-241-8023)

![Portrait of a smiling young woman at home.]()

## What are Dental Implants?

Dental implants are replacements for missing teeth that serve to look, feel, and function like natural teeth. Surgically placed into the jawbone, the implants and your bone gradually fuse together. This allows for the attachment of the replacement tooth such as crowns, bridges, or dentures.

![Dental care, dental implant, 3d rendering]()

## Here’s What to Expect in 4 Steps

## Consultation

Your dentist evaluates your dental health to determine if you’re a candidate for dental implants, considering factors like jawbone condition and tissue health.

![Number Icon One]()

## Implant Placement

Eligible patients undergo surgical implant placement, where the implant serves as a stable foundation for prosthetic teeth.

![Number Icon Two]()

## Healing Period

## What are the Benefits?

Dental implants not only enhance your smile, but also contribute to the well-being of your oral and overall health. Missing teeth can lead to bone loss, changes in facial structure, and difficulties in speaking and chewing. Dental implants play a crucial role by preventing the shifting of teeth, reducing the risk of gum disease, and promoting proper alignment in the bite.

If you’re experiencing any of these symptoms, call today without delay. Our team is here to provide swift and effective care.

## Dental Implants FAQs

If you’re thinking about dental implants, you may have some concerns. Here we’ve addressed common questions.

[SEE All FAQS](/about-us/faqs/)

### What are dental implants, and how do they work?

Dental implants are artificial tooth roots made of titanium that are surgically placed into the jawbone. They provide a sturdy foundation for the customized replacement teeth to match the shape and color of the natural teeth.

### Who is a good candidate for dental implants?

The ideal candidate for dental implants has good overall health, enough bone in their jaw to support the implant, and shows no signs of gum disease. It is best to consult with your dentist to determine if dental implants are right for you.

### How long does the dental implant process take?

The procedure is a lengthy one. Although the process can vary depending on individual circumstances, it typically takes several months to complete. During the healing period, most patients may expect their dental implants to fully fuse to their jawbone within a few weeks to several months. Once this process is complete, an abutment is attached to the implant followed by the replacement tooth attached to the abutment.

### How long do dental implants last?

With proper care and maintenance, dental implants can last a lifetime. Dental implants must be treated like natural teeth: regular brushing, flossing, and dental checkups.

## What Are Dental Sealants?

Dental sealants are thin, protective coatings applied to the chewing surfaces of the molars and premolars. These surfaces often have deep grooves and pits where bacteria and food particles can accumulate, making them more susceptible to decay. Sealants act as a barrier to help prevent bacteria and acids from reaching the tooth enamel and causing cavities.

## What to Expect

When you come in for a dental sealant procedure, our skilled dental team will first thoroughly clean and dry the teeth to be sealed. Next, we’ll apply a special gel that helps the sealant adhere better. After rinsing and drying the teeth again, we’ll carefully paint the liquid sealant onto the chewing surfaces of the teeth. Using a special curing light, we’ll harden the sealant, creating a strong, protective barrier. Finally, we’ll check the sealants to ensure they’re properly bonded and provide instructions for maintaining them.

## What is an Inlay and Onlay?

Inlays and onlays are custom-made dental restorations used to repair moderately damaged or decayed teeth. They are crafted from durable materials such as porcelain or composite resin, and are designed to fit precisely into the prepared cavity of a tooth. Inlays are used to restore the chewing surface of a tooth, while onlays are employed to cover a larger portion of the tooth. 

This procedure is ideal for individuals with moderate to severe tooth decay or damage that cannot be effectively addressed with a traditional filling but doesn’t require a full dental crown. They are particularly suitable for patients who seek a conservative approach to tooth restoration.

## Who Needs a Mouth Guard?

Mouth guards, also known as night guards, provide essential protection for those involved in activities prone to dental or facial injuries. Whether you’re hitting the field for football, shooting hoops in basketball, or skating on the ice in hockey, a mouth guard protects you against impact injuries. But it’s not just for athletes. If you grind or clench your teeth, struggle with TMJ disorders, or deal with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea, a custom-made mouth guard can offer you relief and added protection.

![dentist showing her patient information on a screen]()

## 4 Reasons for a Mouth Guard

## Protection During Contact Sports

Mouth guards shield teeth and jaws from impact injuries, reducing the risk of chipped, broken, or knocked-out teeth.

![Number Icon One]()

## Prevent Teeth Grinding

For individuals who grind or clench their teeth during sleep (bruxism), a custom-made mouth guard provides cushioning and protection.

![Number Icon Two]()

## Relief for TMJ Disorder

Customized mouth guards can help alleviate symptoms of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders by stabilizing the jaw joint.

![Number Icon Three]()

## Sleep Apnea Treatment

For individuals with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea, a mouth guard can help keep the airway open by repositioning the lower jaw and tongue during sleep.

## The Different Types of Mouth Guards

Mouth guards come in three main types, each offering varying levels of fit and protection.

**Stock mouth guards** are pre-formed and readily available at sporting goods stores, but they often provide a poor fit and minimal protection.

**Boil-and-bite mouth guards** are softened in boiling water and then molded to fit the wearer’s teeth.

**Custom-made mouth guards** are recommended for the highest level of fit and protection.

## Mouth Guards FAQs

If you have any questions about mouth guards, we’ve got answers.

### How much does a mouth guard cost at Mt Juliet Dental Group ?

## What Is Gum Disease?

Gum disease, also known as gingivitis, is a common condition characterized by inflammation of the gums. It typically starts with gingivitis, where the gums become swollen and may bleed easily. Without proper treatment, gingivitis can progress to periodontal disease, leading to gum recession, bone loss, and even tooth loss.

Gum disease treatment is a specialized dental service that aims to address the underlying causes, remove plaque and tartar buildup, reduce inflammation, and restore gum health. We provide comprehensive gum disease treatment services to help our patients achieve optimal gum health.

Untreated gum disease can lead to serious complications, including tooth loss, bone damage, and systemic health issues such as heart disease and diabetes.

## What Is a Root Canal?

A root canal, also known as endodontic treatment, is a procedure designed to repair and save a tooth that is severely decayed or infected. During the procedure, the infected or damaged pulp inside the tooth is carefully removed, the inside of the tooth is cleaned and disinfected, and the tooth is then filled and sealed to prevent further infection. This allows you to retain your natural tooth and restore its function and appearance.

![Happy black woman, smile and eating on road trip adventure with friends in travel for summer vacation or journey. African American female smiling and enjoying a healthy meal for holiday traveling.]()

## What is Scaling and Root Planing?

Scaling and root planing is a non-surgical and deep cleaning procedure that removes plaque below the gumline, where regular brushing and flossing can’t reach. Unlike a routine dental cleaning, this procedure is recommended when gum disease progresses from gingivitis to periodontitis, which is damage to the soft tissue around the teeth.

 
During the cleaning, the dental hygienist uses specialized tools to remove plaque and tartar buildup that sits below the gumline and smooths out areas where deposits of bacteria can harbor.

![Young woman patient having dental treatment at dentist's office]()

## Benefits of Scaling and Root Planing

## Effective Plaque Removal

Scaling and root planing effectively removes plaque and tartar buildup from below the gumline, targeting areas that regular brushing and flossing can’t reach.

## Improved Gum Health

![Number Icon Two]()

## Prevent Tooth Loss

![Number Icon Three]()

## What is a Tooth Extraction?

A tooth extraction is a dental procedure in which a tooth is removed from its socket in the jawbone. It is typically performed by a dentist or oral surgeon under local anesthesia to numb the area and minimize discomfort during the procedure.

Tooth extractions may be necessary for various reasons, including severe decay, gum disease, overcrowding, or trauma. During the extraction process, the dentist or oral surgeon will carefully loosen the tooth from its socket using specialized instruments before gently removing it. Following the extraction, the dentist will provide instructions for post-operative care to promote healing and prevent complications.

## Tooth Extractions FAQs

If you have any questions about tooth extractions, we’ve got answers.

[SEE All FAQS](/about-us/faqs/)

### What should I expect during the tooth extraction process?

First, your dentist will numb the affected area with a local anesthetic. Next, they will use specialized tools to remove the damaged or infected tooth. Following the extraction, you’ll receive aftercare instructions to ensure a comfortable recovery.

### Will tooth extraction hurt?

We take every precaution to ensure a comfortable, pain-free tooth extraction experience for our patients. While there may be some discomfort or mild pain during the recovery process, most patients report little to no pain during the actual procedure.

### How long does tooth extraction take?

The length of the tooth extraction process can vary depending on the complexity of the procedure and the patient's needs. In general, most tooth extractions take less than an hour to complete.

### How long is the recovery period after tooth extraction?

The recovery period can vary depending on a variety of factors, such as the complexity of the procedure, the patient's age and overall health, and how well they follow post-operative care instructions. Generally, it is normal to experience some discomfort, swelling, and bleeding in the first few days after the procedure. Most patients can expect to fully recover within one to two weeks.

### Can I eat normally after a tooth extraction?

It is important to avoid eating hard or chewy foods for the first few days, as this can irritate the extraction site and slow down the healing process. Instead, stick to soft foods that are easy to chew and swallow, such as soup, yogurt, or mashed potatoes. As you begin to feel more comfortable, you can gradually reintroduce solid foods into your diet, but be sure to follow your dentist's instructions and avoid foods that may be too hot or spicy.

## What Is Teeth Whitening?

Teeth whitening is a cosmetic dental procedure designed to lighten the color of your teeth and remove stains and discoloration. Using bleaching agents, our whitening treatments penetrate the enamel to break up stains and reveal a brighter, whiter smile.

Professional teeth whitening offers two primary methods: in-office whitening and at-home whitening kits. In-office treatments are typically quicker, involving the application of a high-concentration bleaching gel and sometimes light activation for accelerated results. At-home kits involve custom-fitted trays and a lower-concentration bleaching gel for gradual whitening over several weeks

Tooth bridges are prosthetic devices used to replace one or more missing teeth by bridging the gap between remaining teeth. They consist of one or more artificial teeth which are anchored in place by crowns on adjacent healthy teeth or dental implants. By seamlessly filling the gaps left by missing teeth, bridges enhance both your oral health and overall well-being, offering a long-lasting solution that restores functionality and natural appearance.

## Understanding the Veneers Process

During your initial consultation, our experienced dental team will assess your oral health and discuss your goals and expectations for treatment. If veneers are determined to be the right option for you, we will create a customized treatment plan tailored to your unique needs and desired goals.

The veneer process typically involves three main steps and minimal discomfort. First, your dental team will prepare your teeth by removing a small amount of enamel to accommodate the veneers. Then, they will take impressions of your teeth to create custom-made veneers that fit perfectly. Finally, the veneers are bonded to the front surface of your teeth, instantly transforming your smile.

## What to Expect

The wisdom tooth removal process begins with a consultation where X-rays are taken to assess the position and condition of the wisdom teeth. Before the procedure, local or general anesthesia is administered to ensure comfort during the surgery. The oral surgeon or dentist then makes an incision in the gum tissue to access the tooth and removes the wisdom tooth carefully. After extraction, the area is cleaned, and stitches may be placed to promote healing.

## Wisdom Teeth Removal FAQs

If you have any questions about wisdom teeth removal, we’ve got answers.

[SEE All FAQS](/about-us/faqs/)

### What is wisdom teeth removal?

Wisdom teeth removal is a dental procedure to extract one or more of your third molars, located at the back of your mouth.

### Is wisdom teeth removal painful?

We take extra care to ensure our patients are comfortable throughout the procedure, using local anesthesia to minimize any discomfort.

### How long does it take to recover from wisdom teeth removal?

Recovery time varies by individual, but most people can return to their normal routine within a few days to a week.

### How can I prepare for wisdom teeth removal?

We recommend you avoid eating or drinking anything for a few hours before the procedure, and arranging for someone to drive you home afterward.

### What should I expect during the procedure?

During the procedure, we'll numb the area with local anesthesia and carefully remove the tooth. You may feel some pressure, but you shouldn't feel any pain.

## How PPO Dental Plans Work

A Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) is the most common form of dental insurance, offering members a network of participating dentists to choose from. Dentists in this network agree to lower fee schedules, resulting in greater cost savings for patients. PPO plans cover a percentage of treatment costs, typically paying 50% for major treatments like crowns and bridges, 80% for basic care like fillings, and up to 100% for preventative care such as exams and cleanings. These plans often have annual maximums ranging from $1,000 to $2,000 and assist with insurance billing.

![Young beautiful smiling asian woman in casual sweater drawing on digital tablet with stylus while sitting on armchair in cozy living room]()

## Understanding your HMO

Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), also known as capitated or prepaid insurance, is a type of dental insurance plan that requires patients to choose a primary care dentist from a network of providers. This primary care dentist coordinates all aspects of the patient’s dental care and referrals to specialists within the HMO network. HMO plans typically have lower premiums and fixed copayments for covered services, but patients have limited choices in selecting dentists outside the network. Additionally, HMO plans may require patients to obtain pre-authorization for certain treatments, and coverage for out-of-network care is usually not provided except in emergencies.

## Dental Insurance FAQs

Got questions? We have answers! Check out our FAQ section to learn everything you need to know about navigating dental insurance coverage.

[SEE All FAQS](/about-us/faqs/)

### What is optional treatment?

Treatment that is either not listed on your fee schedule or more than the minimum to restore the tooth back to its original function.

### What's a covered benefit?

Treatment that is recommended by a dentist, is listed on the fee schedule, and accepted under the terms of your group's plan.

### What's the difference between indemnity, PPO, HMO, & discount insurance plans?

Indemnity or Traditional Insurance reimburses members or dentists at the dentist's UCR (Usual, Customary & Reasonable fee). This allows the subscriber to go to any dental office without being limited to a panel.
