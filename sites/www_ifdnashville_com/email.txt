SUBJECT: Helping Patients Quickly Find Answers on Your Website—See a Simple Example

-----------------------------------------

Hi Dr. Parkes and team,

Iroquois Dentistry stands out for its top-rated care and your commitment to patient comfort, technology, and transparency. I noticed how much you invest in helping people understand their options—from same-day crowns to implant-supported restorations, veneers, and flexible financing.

I’m Zac, founder of SlayDigital.ai. We help practices like yours save time and guide website visitors with a simple, custom AI chat agent. It sits on your site and lets people ask questions—answering instantly, using your site’s own content. No technical jargon or complexity needed.

I’ve created a short demo using a copy of your website here: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_ifdnashville_com  
Just click the chat icon at the bottom-right, type a question, and see how it responds in plain English, directly from your existing info.

Visitors can ask things like:
- “How much do same-day crowns or veneers cost?”
- “Do you offer emergency dental care after hours?”
- “What financing or payment plans are available?”
- “Which procedures are covered by insurance?”
- “Who are your dentists and what are their specialties?”

If you’d like to see how this might help reduce phone and email volume while making key info easier to find, just let me know—I’m happy to tailor a version for your real site, no pressure or obligation.

Thanks for your time,  
Zac
