Hi team,

With Wikipedia connecting millions to free knowledge in so many languages, I noticed your homepage is packed with links, language options, and donation prompts—all important, but possibly overwhelming for some visitors.

At SlayDigital.ai, we build simple AI web agents that help site visitors get instant answers by chatting directly with your site’s content—no jargon or complexity. I’ve put together a quick demo based on your homepage: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_wikipedia_org

Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right, and type a question—our agent responds using info already on the page.

You can try asking things like:
- How many articles are in English Wikipedia?
- Where can I donate to support Wikipedia?
- How do I change the language on this page?
- What is the average donation amount?
- Which languages have over 1 million articles?

Would love to hear your thoughts or set up a 10-minute call if you’re curious to see how this could help more visitors find what they need, faster.

Best,  
Zac
