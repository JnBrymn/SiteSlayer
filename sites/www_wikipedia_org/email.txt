SUBJECT: Exploring a Simpler Way to Help Users Find Wikimedia Privacy and Policy Answers

-----------------------------------------

Hi Wikimedia Foundation team,

Your commitment to open knowledge (and transparency about how it’s governed) truly sets a global standard. Navigating the comprehensive Terms of Use and Privacy Policy pages, though, I can see how even seasoned contributors or readers might get lost looking for a clear answer!

At SlayDigital.ai, we build simple, custom website chat agents that help visitors quickly get what they need—using only the information you already provide. I put together a live demo tailored to your site: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_wikipedia_org

There’s a chat icon in the bottom right; clicking it opens a box where you can ask questions and the agent responds with answers based on existing site content.

You can try asking things like:
- “How do I request my personal data or ask for it to be deleted?” 
- “Who should I contact about a privacy concern or data access request?” 
- “What information is public when I edit Wikimedia projects?”
- “How are user contributions governed under the Terms of Use?”
- “How does Wikimedia respond to ‘Do Not Track’ browser signals?”

If you think an interactive, always-on policy guide could reduce support emails and clarify these vital topics, I’d be glad to show you how this could fit seamlessly into your sites.

Let me know if you’d like to discuss or try a custom agent for your team.

Best regards,  
Zac Slay
