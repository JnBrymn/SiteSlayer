Wikipedia was just a dream.

Readers in the United States deserve an explanation.

Please don't skip this 1-minute read. If you're like us, you've used Wikipedia countless times. To settle an argument with a friend. To satisfy a curiosity. Whether it's 3 in the morning or afternoon, Wikipedia is useful in your life. Please give $2.75.

Wikipedia's been around since 2001. Back then, it was just a wildly ambitious, probably impossible dream. But it came together piece by pieceâcreated by people, not machines. Wikipedia's not perfect, but it's always been free thanks to everyday readers.

Only 2% ever donate. But that small group makes a big difference. When you support Wikipedia, you're standing up for something simple but profound: that knowledge should belong to everyone.

If you agree, then this is your moment to give back. Even $2.75 makes a difference. Help keep it goingâfor you, for the next reader, and for the next generation.

Please select an amount (USD).
The average donation in the United States is around $13. Many first-time donors give $2.75. All that matters is that you're choosing to stand up for free, open information; and for that, you have our gratitude.

### The internet we were promised

Most people donate because Wikipedia is the internet we were promised: useful, free, and filled with reliable, human-created knowledge. If you agree, please give $2.75. If everyone reading this right now gave just $2.75, we'd reach our goal quickly.

â *The Wikimedia Foundation, host of Wikipedia and other free knowledge projects*.
