SUBJECT: Helping Patients Find Answers—See a New Way to Engage on Your Website

-----------------------------------------
Hi East Nashville Family Dentistry team,

I came across your website and was impressed by the range of services you offer for patients in the Nashville community, from preventive care to same-day emergency appointments. Your focus on comfort and clear communication really stands out.

I'm Zac from SlayDigital.ai. We build simple AI chat agents that can be embedded on your website, allowing visitors to ask questions and get instant answers directly from your existing content—no extra setup or technical jargon needed.

For a quick example, I’ve set up a demo using a replica of your site:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/enfdentistry_com  
Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner to open the chat and try asking questions—your AI agent will answer using real information from your pages.

You can try asking things like:
- Do you accept my insurance plan?
- What’s the difference between dentures and dental implants?
- How soon can I get a same-day emergency appointment?
- What’s included in a general dentistry visit?
- How much does teeth whitening cost?

If you think this could help your patients get answers faster or free up your front desk, I’d be happy to chat or get your feedback.

Warm regards,  
Zac Slay
