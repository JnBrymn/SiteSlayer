-----------------------------------------

Hi East Nashville Family Dentistry team,

I’m Zac from SlayDigital.ai, and I’ve been looking at how welcoming and informative your website is—it’s clear you care about guiding patients every step of the way, whether it’s for routine care or emergencies.

We build simple, custom AI chat agents that let visitors get quick, accurate answers using your existing site content—not AI jargon or fluff, just clear help when people need it. I set up a quick demo based on your own site, so you can see how it fits in: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/enfdentistry_com

Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner to try it out. Type a question, and the agent will reply using the information already on your website.

You can try asking things like:
- What dental insurance plans do you accept?
- How soon can I get a same-day emergency appointment?
- What’s included in a general checkup and cleaning?
- Do you offer Invisalign or other clear aligners?
- How much do dental implants cost per tooth?

If you’d like to see how this could help your practice reduce repetitive calls and help patients feel supported 24/7, just let me know—I’d be happy to talk through it with you.

Best,  
Zac
