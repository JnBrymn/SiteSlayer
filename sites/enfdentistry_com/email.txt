SUBJECT: A Simple Way to Answer Patient Questions Instantly on Your Website

-----------------------------------------
Hi there,

I’ve been browsing the East Nashville Family Dentistry website and I appreciate how easy you make it for families to learn about your care and services—especially for new patients looking for affordable, comprehensive dental options.

I’m Zac from SlayDigital.ai. We help practices like yours reduce repetitive calls and emails by adding a simple, custom AI web agent to your site. This agent can answer common questions using only the information you already provide online, helping patients get clear answers instantly.

To show what this could look like, we put together a live example using your website:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/enfdentistry_com  
Just click the chat icon at the bottom-right of the page—then type in a question to see it in action.

You can try asking things like:
- “Do you accept my dental insurance?”
- “What should I expect at my first appointment?”
- “Do you offer emergency same-day care?”
- “How much does teeth whitening cost?”
- “What options are available for missing teeth?”

If you’re curious how this could simplify interactions for your team and offer a smoother patient experience, I’m happy to chat or provide more details—no pressure.

Best regards,  
Zac
