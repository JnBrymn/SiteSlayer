Subject: Quick Idea to Help Big Thunder Events’ Guests Find the Perfect Rental

Hi there,

I was browsing Big Thunder Events and was impressed by the massive range of party rentals you offer—from carnival rides and bounce houses to tents and concessions. I imagine guests sometimes have questions about availability, package options, or the right rental for their event type.

I run slaydigital.ai, and we make simple web agents that sit right on your site. With one, your visitors could chat instantly with your existing information—helping them quickly find pricing, booking steps, or which rentals work for their party—without having to search or call.

This can save your team from answering the same questions and make it easy for customers to get exactly what they want, right when they need it.

Let me know if you’d be interested in seeing a quick demo, or if you have any questions—I’m happy to help.

Best,
