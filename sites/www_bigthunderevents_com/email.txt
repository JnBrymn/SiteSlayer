SUBJECT: Make Event Planning Easier for Your Guests with a Website Chat Agent

Hi Tony & Kacey,

I’m Zac, founder of SlayDigital.ai. I know that at Big Thunder Events, your team puts a lot of care into making every party and festival smooth and stress-free—from helping customers pick the right inflatables to answering all those power, setup, and booking questions.

We build simple, custom AI-powered website chat agents that answer visitor questions directly from your existing site content. It’s a quick, helpful way to reduce repetitive calls and make your customers’ event planning that much easier.

To give you a feel for how this could work for Big Thunder Events, I set up a mock demo using your site:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_bigthunderevents_com  
There’s a chat icon in the bottom-right corner—click it, and you can type in questions as if you were a guest. The agent responds using info already on your website.

You can try asking things like:
- What’s included with a bounce house rental?  
- How far in advance should I reserve for a large event?  
- Do you offer discounts for schools or churches?  
- What are the power requirements for mechanical rides?  
- Which areas do you deliver to, and are there extra travel fees?

If you think this kind of tool would be helpful for your customers (and maybe lighten your team’s inbox), just let me know. I’d love to hear your thoughts and answer any questions.

Best,  
Zac Slay
