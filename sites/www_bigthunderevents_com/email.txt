SUBJECT: Help Your Customers Find the Perfect Rental—Instantly with an AI Chat Agent

-----------------------------------------
Hi Big Thunder Events team,

Your website does an awesome job showcasing a huge variety of inflatables, carnival rides, and event options for every kind of party. With so many services, we know customers can get stuck searching or have repeat questions—especially during busy times.

That’s why I thought you might like to see something new: at SlayDigital.ai, we build simple AI web agents that let your visitors chat directly with your site’s info—making it easy for anyone to find what they need.

Here’s a hands-on example using a mock version of your site:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_bigthunderevents_com  
Just click the chat icon in the lower right corner, type a question, and the agent replies instantly using your own site content.

You can try asking things like:
- “Which bounce houses are best for toddlers?”
- “Do you deliver water slides to Franklin, TN?”
- “How much does a mechanical bull rental cost, and what’s included?”
- “What’s your bad weather and cancellation policy?”
- “Can you help with park or corporate event paperwork like insurance certificates?”

It’s a fast, friendly way to reduce phone tag and guide more visitors to a booking—especially when you offer as much as Big Thunder Events does.

Would you be open to a quick chat? Happy to answer any questions, or just hear what you think.

All the best,  
Zac
