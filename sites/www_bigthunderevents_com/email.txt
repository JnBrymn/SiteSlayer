Hi Big Thunder Events team,

I love your commitment to making every event in Nashville and beyond a big success—your reviews and your focus on customer service really stand out.

I'm Zac from SlayDigital.ai. We build custom, easy-to-use AI chat agents that live right on your website and help visitors get fast answers by chatting directly with your own content—no AI buzzwords, just practical help.

I put together a quick mock-up of your website so you can see this in action:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_bigthunderevents_com  
Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner, and type any question—your visitors get instant answers pulled from your site’s info.

You can try asking things like:
- What areas do you deliver to?
- How do I book a bounce house for a birthday party?
- Are your rentals insured and do rates include setup?
- Can you handle large events like school fairs or corporate picnics?
- What’s included with the party packages?

If you'd like to see how this agent could help reduce calls, speed up bookings, or answer common questions (especially during busy weekends), just reply here and I’ll be happy to chat.

Thanks for making parties so easy for Nashville families!

Best,  
Zac
