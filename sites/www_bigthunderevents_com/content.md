[Park Event Info](#accn2at_0_collapseOne)

### 📄 Certificate of Insurance (COI)

**Does your park require a COI?**  
Most do—and we’ve got you covered. Just let us know:

- The **official name and address** of the entity that needs to be listed
- At least **72 hours in advance** so we can process the request

- Each item’s power needs are listed online
- Some parks have limited outlets—or none at all

💡 **Pro Tip:** **Rent a generator from Big Thunder Events** and skip the power stress altogether!

---

Parks have tight rental windows—and so do we.  
Here’s how to keep it smooth:

- Let us know **when your park rental starts and ends**
- You **must be on-site** during both setup and pickup

[Backyard Event Info](#accn2at_0_collapseTwo)

### 🛡️ Insurance Matters

**Not all rental companies are created equal.**  
Make sure whoever you rent from carries **liability insurance**—because accidents can happen, even when you're prepared.  
⚠️ **Saving a few bucks on Marketplace isn’t worth the risk of a lawsuit.**  
✅ Good news: **Big Thunder Events is fully insured and safety certified.**

---

### ⚡ Power Up

Each inflatable or ride requires specific power—and it must be available within **100 feet** of the setup area.  
Check the equipment listing for exact power needs.

💡 **Pro Tip:** Want peace of mind?  
**Rent a generator from Big Thunder Events** and skip the guesswork.

---

### ☎️ Call Before You Stake: **811**

Hosting your event on grass? We use **18"–42" steel stakes** for safety—and that means going deep.  
✅ Call **811** at least 2–3 business days before your event to **mark underground utilities**.  
It’s free, fast, and could save you from serious (and expensive) damage.

---

### 💦 Water Party Ready?

Planning to rent a **waterslide or splash unit**?

- Make sure your **hose is long enough** to reach from the water source to the back of the setup area
- If you're running **multiple water activities**, ensure there's enough **water pressure** and use **splitters or extra sources**

  - Help pivot if needed (don’t worry—we’re great at rolling with changes!)

---

### 📞 Contact Info Matters

We’ll call when we’re en route, so we **need the cell number** of the person who will **be on-site** during delivery.  
That way, we’re not calling the main office line while sitting outside your event!  
✅ Please provide the **direct number of the designated on-site contact.**

---

We believe in giving back to those who give so much to their communities.

Planning a company picnic, employee appreciation day, or corporate carnival? Big Thunder Events brings top-tier fun with white-glove service. Here’s what you need to know to make your corporate event a seamless success:

---

### 📄 Certificate of Insurance (COI)

Most corporate venues require a COI—we’re happy to provide one!  
We’ll just need:

- The **exact name and address** of the entity to be listed
- At least **72 hours’ notice** to request and process it

✅ We’re fully insured and experienced with all types of corporate venues.

---

### ⚡ Power Requirements

Each piece of equipment has its **power needs listed online**—please make sure your venue can provide enough power.

- **Multiple inflatables or rides = multiple circuits**
- **Generators are highly recommended** for outdoor setups or uncertain venues

💡 **Pro Tip:** Want peace of mind?  
**Rent a generator from Big Thunder Events** and skip the guesswork.

---

### 💳 Business Check Payments

We accept:

- **Business checks only** for deposits and final payment (This saves you a 3% card fee on orders over $1000)
- ✅ Schools, churches, governments, and other verified organizations
- ❌ No personal checks, please

---

We arrive **early** to ensure everything is ready before guests arrive.

Please ensure someone is on-site who can:

- Show us the layout
- Sign off on placement/paperwork (18+)
- Assist with any day-of changes (don’t worry—we pivot like pros)

---

### 📞 On-Site Contact Info

We’ll call with an ETA before arrival—so we need the **direct number** of the **on-site contact** (not the main office line).  
Whether they volunteered or were “voluntold,” we’ll need to reach them quickly to make sure everything runs smoothly and stays on time.

Need help planning your next corporate event?  
📞 Call us at [**866‑246‑5867**](tel:866‑246‑5867) or email us at **[info@bigthunderevents.com](mailto:info@bigthunderevents.com)** to get started.

Let Big Thunder Events help you build a company celebration that stands out from the rest. ⚡🎉

[Mechanical & Carnival Rides Info](#accn2at_0_collapseFive)

Booking the big stuff? Here's what you need to know before we roll in with the *really* epic attractions.

---

### ⚡ Power

Most mechanical rides include their own power source—easy!  
**Exceptions:**

- **Mechanical Bull**
- **Bungee Jump**  
  These require separate power—check with us for specifics.

💡 Not sure what your ride needs? **Call us** and we’ll make sure you’re covered.

---

### 🚛 Full Parking Required

Mechanical rides aren’t just dropped off—they stay connected to our **truck and trailer** during the event (in most cases).  
Here’s what that means for you:

- Rides like **swings, spinners**, and some **carnival rides** operate directly from the trailer
- Units like the **Mechanical Bull** or **Trackless Train** may detach, but still require **parking access nearby**

✅ You’ll need to reserve space for our **truck & trailer** to remain for the **entire duration of the event**

Got a tight layout or funky park entrance?  
📞 **Give us a shout** before event day—we’ll help map it out.  
We’re great at problem-solving... but we’d rather not back into a bounce house or jungle gym 😄⚡

---

### ⛅ Weather Policy

**Rain or shine, mechanical and carnival rides are locked in.**  
Once booked:

- 🚫 **No cancellations**
- 🚫 **No reschedules**

These items require extra planning and coordination, so once they’re on the books—they’re committed.

---

# 🎉 Frequently Asked Questions – Big Thunder Events 🎉

## 🎪 Top 5 Things to Look for When Choosing an Inflatable or Carnival Rental

[⚡ Experience That Delivers](#accn23at_0_collapseOne)

Look for a company that’s been tested by time, not just trending.  
**Big Thunder Events has been serving Middle Tennessee since 2005**, handling everything from backyard birthdays to corporate festivals. We’ve seen it all, solved it all, and brought the fun every step of the way.

[🛠️ Licensed, Insured & Professionally Staffed](#accn23at_0_collapseTwo)

Your event deserves more than “guy with a trailer” energy.  
We’re a **fully licensed and insured company** with trained crews and optional staffing for events of all sizes. We even provide operators for mechanical rides and offer **full event management** if you want to sit back and actually enjoy the day.

[🧠 Planning Help You Can Count On](#accn23at_0_collapseThree)

We’ll help match the right units to your age group, space, and vibe—whether you’re planning a preschool water day, a church carnival, or a school-wide field day. **Need a full layout plan or help with crowd flow? Just ask.**

[💥 A Reputation Built on Results](#accn23at_0_collapseFour)

Great reviews don’t lie. Big Thunder Events is known across Middle Tennessee for **on-time setup, professional crews, and events that go off without a hitch**. Just ask a local school, church, or PTO—we’ve probably already worked with them.

Big Thunder Events proudly serves **Nashville, Murfreesboro, Franklin, Brentwood, Smyrna**, and most of **Middle Tennessee**. If you're within about an hour of Murfreesboro, there's a good chance we deliver to you.

[Do prices include delivery and setup?](#accn3at_0_collapseTwo)

Our rental prices include **professional setup and takedown** of your equipment. However, **a travel fee** is added based on your event location. This covers fuel, crew time, and logistics.

You’ll always receive a **detailed quote with all fees included** before confirming your reservation—**no surprises**.

Need a quick estimate? Call us at [**(866) 246-5867**](tel:(866) 246-5867) and we’ll be happy to help.

[How far in advance should I book?](#accn3at_0_collapseThree)

We recommend booking **as early as possible**, especially for **weekends, school field days, church events, and large festivals**.

Spring and summer dates fill up fast, and popular items are often reserved **weeks—even months—in advance**.  
That said, if your event is coming up soon, give us a call—we’ll do our best to make it happen!

📞 [**(866) 246-5867**](tel:(866) 246-5867) | ✉️ **[**info@bigthunderevents.com**](mailto:info@bigthunderevents.com)**

[Can I rent multiple inflatables for one event?](#accn3at_0_collapseFour)

Yes! In fact, **many of our clients rent multiple inflatables or attractions** for school field days, church festivals, corporate events, and large parties.

We also offer **multi-unit discounts** for **schools, churches, and nonprofits**, so you can get more fun for your budget.

Not sure what combos work best together? Give us a call at [**(866) 246-5867**](tel:(866) 246-5867), and we’ll help you build the perfect event lineup.

## ⚡ Power & Setup Requirements

[What kind of power is required?](#accn14at_0_collapseOne)

Each inflatable requires **one or more blowers**, and **each blower must have its own dedicated 20-amp circuit**, not just a separate outlet. Most outlets in homes or parks are linked to the same circuit, so plugging into two nearby plugs could still **overload and trip the breaker**.

We provide up to **100 feet of commercial-grade extension cord per blower**.

Not sure if your setup can handle it? **Just ask!** Or skip the guesswork and **rent one of our [generators](https://www.bigthunderevents.com/items/generator/?ssq=GENERATOR)** to keep everything running smoothly.  
📞 [**(866) 246-5867**](tel:(866) 246-5867) | ✉️ **[**info@bigthunderevents.com**](mailto: info@bigthunderevents.com)**

[Can you set up on concrete, turf, or indoors?](#accn14at_0_collapseTwo)

Yes! We can set up on **grass, turf, concrete, asphalt, gym floors, or indoors**. Just let us know your surface type when booking so we can bring the right anchoring equipment (like **sandbags or water barrels** instead of stakes).

> 🚫 **Please note:** We do **not** set up on **gravel, loose rock, or aggregate driveways**, as these surfaces can damage the equipment and create safety issues.

Have questions about your setup area? We’ll help you plan a safe and smooth event!   
📞 [**(866) 246-5867**](tel:(866) 246-5867) | ✉️ **[info@bigthunderevents.com](mailto:info@bigthunderevents.com)**

[How much space is needed for setup?](#accn14at_0_collapseThree)

Each inflatable or ride has its own size requirements, but as a general rule, we recommend **at least 2 feet of clearance on all sides**, including **overhead clearance** for tall slides or games. You can find exact measurements listed in each unit’s description.

If you’re unsure whether your space will work, just ask!  
And don’t forget, we also need room for **setup access**, especially for larger rides or obstacle courses.

Need help planning your layout? We offer **on-site walk-throughs for an additional fee**. Or **Give us a call or email us and we’ll walk you through the process:**  
📞[**(866) 246-5867**](tel:(866) 246-5867) | ✉️ **[info@bigthunderevents.com](mailto:info@bigthunderevents.com)**

[What power is required for Mechanical/Carnival rides?](#accn14at_0_collapseFour)

We **provide power for all mechanical and carnival rides** as part of your rental. However, most of these attractions require a **50-amp RV-style outlet** to operate safely and reliably.

If your location doesn't have the correct outlet available, don’t worry—we’ll bring a **generator setup** to power the ride. Our team will go over all power needs with you during the booking process to ensure everything runs smoothly.

📞 **Have questions about power access?** Give us a call at [**(866) 246-5867**](tel:(866) 246-5867) or email **[info@bigthunderevents.com](mailto:info@bigthunderevents.com)** and we’ll walk you through the details.

[what are the Setup & Site Requirements?](#accn14at_0_collapseFive)

To ensure a smooth and safe event, here’s what we need for setup:

✅ **Flat, clear space** — free of debris, holes, sharp objects, or overhead obstructions (like trees or power lines).  
✅ **Access to power** — most inflatables require a **dedicated 20-amp outlet per blower** within 100 feet.  
✅ **Surface type** — we can set up on **grass, turf, concrete, asphalt, or indoors**. Let us know your surface in advance.  
🚫 We do **not** set up on gravel, loose rock, or aggregate driveways.

We also need **clear access to the setup area**, including gates wide enough for equipment ( four feet minimum) and no tight turns or steep inclines.

Have a tight space or are unsure if your site will work?  
We offer **on-site walk-throughs for an additional fee** and will gladly help you plan your layout.  
📞 Call us at [**(866) 246-5867**](tel:(866) 246-5867) or email **[info@bigthunderevents.com](mailto:info@bigthunderevents.com)** and we’ll walk you through it!

However, if equipment is damaged due to **misuse, negligence, or prohibited items** (like food, drinks, silly string, or confetti inside inflatables), you may be responsible for **cleaning, repair, or replacement costs**.

[Do you have insurance?](#accn16at_0_collapseFour)

Yes! Big Thunder Events is **fully licensed and insured**, including **general liability coverage** for all our equipment and services.

[Will Big Thunder Events ever cancel our event?](#accn16at_0_collapseFive)

We do everything possible to deliver as promised—but **safety always comes first**.

Big Thunder Events reserves the right to **cancel or postpone a rental** if conditions are unsafe, including:

- 🌬️ **High winds (20+ MPH)**
- ⛈️ **Severe weather or lightning**
- ⚠️ **Unsafe setup surfaces** (like steep hills or loose gravel)
- 🔌 **Power issues or blocked access** at the setup site

If we must cancel, we’ll **communicate with you directly** and do our best to **reschedule or credit your event**, especially when the issue is something neither of us can control.

Questions about your site or the forecast?  
📞 Call us at [**(866) 246-5867**](tel:(866) 246-5867) or ✉️ email **[info@bigthunderevents.com](mailto:info@bigthunderevents.com)**—we’re happy to help!

📞 Call [**(866) 246-5867**](tel:(866) 246-5867) or email **[info@bigthunderevents.com](mailto:info@bigthunderevents.com)**

Heads up—we’re rolling in with a full-size truck and trailer, sometimes up to 28 feet long, so we’ll need room to pull in, unload, and park during setup.

Please make sure:

- 🚗 Driveways or access points are clear
- 🚫 No vehicles are blocking the setup area
- 🔓 Gates are unlocked
- 🌳 No tight turns, low-hanging branches (9’ tall trailer), or hidden obstacles
- If the only access is via a loading dock, let us know in advance so we can make the right arrangements.

  🎡 MECHANICAL RIDES = FULL PARKING REQUIRED

  If your event includes a mechanical, trackless trains or carnival ride, we’ll need space to park the truck and trailer for the entire event, not just setup.  
  Many rides stay connected to the trailer during operation (like swings, spinners, etc.). Others—like our trackless trains or Mechanical Bulls—may detach, but still need trailer access nearby.

  Got a tricky setup or weird layout? Give us a shout and we’ll help you make a game plan.  
  We’re good at navigating—but backing a trailer into a jungle gym isn’t exactly part of the Big Thunder dream. 😄⚡

[🌦 BAD WEATHER? WE GET IT.](#accn5at_0_collapseFour)

If the forecast shows a 50% chance or higher of rain during your event time and you're thinking about rescheduling—no problem. We offer one fee-free reschedule with full payment, as long as you let us know when we call with your delivery ETA.

We’ll move your event to a new date at no extra charge, and you won’t owe a dime on the reschedule.

💵 Paying by check? No worries—you’ll have 7 days to mail it in. If we don’t receive it in that timeframe, your deposit will be forfeited.

🗓️ Reschedules are subject to availability, and substitutions may apply depending on what's available for your new date.

BUT — once you give us the green light and say, “Let’s roll!” during that ETA call, your payment becomes locked in—rain or shine.

That call is your moment to decide, so if Mother Nature looks moody, don’t wait to speak up! ⚡🌧️

#### 🎡 Carnival & Mechanical Rides

These attractions are rain or shine and cannot be canceled or rescheduled once booked.  
Due to staffing, logistics, and vendor commitments, no refunds or changes are available for these items under any circumstances.

[⚡THE SETUP TRIFECTA: FLAT, CLEAN, POWERED](#accn5at_0_collapseFive)

# ⚙️ Setup & Site Requirements

Before we roll in with the fun, here's everything you need to know to keep your event safe, smooth, and Thunder-worthy.

---

### ⏰ **THE EARLY BIRD BRINGS THE BOUNCE**

We might arrive **up to 4 hours before** your scheduled rental time—sometimes as early as **5:30 AM**. Why? Because we want every setup perfect and on time, especially for larger or more complex events.  
✅ **No stress:** Your rental time still starts as scheduled.  
⚠️ If you hear us rolling up at sunrise—it’s just that Big Thunder magic at work. ⚡☀️

---

### ⏰ **Timing Matters – Help Us Keep the Thunder Rolling!**

Our delivery schedule is tight—we’re on a mission to bring the fun all day long.

Here’s what you can expect:

- 📞 You’ll get a **30-minute ETA call** when we’re en route
- 🕔 **More than 5 minutes late?** A **$50 wait fee** applies
- 🕒 **More than 15 minutes late?** We’ll move on and **reschedule your delivery to the end of the route**

⚡ Please be on-site and ready when we arrive—your whole event depends on it!

---

### ⚡ **POWER UP!**

Each blower requires **its own dedicated electrical circuit**—not just another outlet on the same line.

**Here’s the breakdown:**

- Multiple blowers = multiple circuits
- We provide **up to 100 feet of extension cord per blower**
- Power **must be ready and working** when we arrive
- Running cords through a door or window? It’ll need to stay open during the event

🚫 **No daisy chains, plug splitters, or customer cords.**  
We only use our **safety-rated 100' cords** designed for our equipment.

💡 *Not sure about your setup?*  
Call us at **+1-866-246-5867**—or rent a generator for total peace of mind.

---

### 🧼 **CLEAN ZONE = FUN ZONE**

Before we can blow up the fun, your setup space must be:

- Flat
- Clean
- Safe

**Please clear the area of:**

- 🪨 Rocks or debris
- 🔪 Sharp objects
- 💩 Pet “surprises” (yep, we’ll know)
- 🌳 Low branches, power lines, basketball goals, or shade structures—most units need **18–22 ft of vertical clearance**

🚫 We do **not** set up on gravel or rock.  
✅ Acceptable surfaces: **Flat grass, concrete, asphalt, or turf**

A clean, clear area = faster setup and max bounce time. Let’s do it right! 🎉⚡

---

### 🌱 **GRASS SETUP? CALL BEFORE WE STAKE!**

We anchor all inflatables with **18"–42" steel stakes** when setting up on grass. That means **deep ground penetration**—and potential contact with underground lines.

**Before we arrive:**  
📍 **Mark your sprinkler systems and underground lines**  
📞 Call **811** to mark utilities for free—it’s fast and protects your lawn (and your wallet)

Big Thunder is **not liable** for damage to unmarked utilities.

Let’s keep your yard safe—and your party grounded! ⚡🌾

[🏗️ SETUP POLICIES](#accn6at_0_collapseOne)

### One Setup, One Spot

Once our crew begins setup, that location is final.  
🔁 **Want it moved?** A **40% relocation fee** applies and must be paid **before we move anything**. Plan ahead to save time and money!

### Delivery & Wait Time

- Our crews may arrive **up to 4 hours early**, sometimes as early as **5:30 AM**, to stay on schedule.
- Your **rental time starts as scheduled**, regardless of delivery time—there is **no early delivery fee**.
- You'll get a **30-minute ETA call** before arrival.
- If our crew waits more than **10 minutes**, a **$50 wait fee** applies.
- If the wait exceeds **20 minutes**, we will proceed to our next event and your delivery will be moved to the **end of the route for the day**.

### Park Events

Hosting your event at a park? Here’s what you need to know:

- Most parks require a **Certificate of Insurance (COI)** — we need **3 business days** to process your request
- Power must be within **100 feet** of setup location  
  ⚠️ If not, you’ll need to **rent a generator** from us

[🌧 WEATHER & RESCHEDULING POLICIES](#accn6at_0_collapseTwo)

If the forecast shows 50%+ chance of rain during your event time and you want to reschedule, no problem—we offer one fee-free reschedule with full payment. Just tell us during the delivery ETA call.

- Paying by check? You’ve got 7 days to mail it in. If not, your deposit is forfeited.
- Reschedules are subject to availability and substitutions may apply.
- Once you say “Let’s roll!”, payment is locked in—rain or shine.

Carnival/Mechanical Rides:  
Rain or shine, no cancellations or reschedules. These items are locked in once booked.

### 💨 SAFETY FIRST — WIND IS A BIG DEAL

If winds hit 20+ MPH, inflatables become unsafe to operate—no matter how well they’re staked down.

If the weather turns, you must unplug the unit and stop use immediately.  
Safety always comes first—for you, your guests, and our crew.

Big Thunder Events reserves the right to cancel or postpone events due to high winds or unsafe weather conditions at our discretion.  
  
If it’s not safe to operate, we won’t risk it—and we know you wouldn’t want us to.

- Reschedules (non-weather):  
  - More than 72 hrs = 50% payment upfront, no extra fees
  - Less than 72 hrs = 30% restocking fee + full payment for reschedule

Carnival/Mechanical Rides:  
Rain or shine, no cancellations or reschedules. These items are locked in once booked.

[🚨 CANCELLATION & RESCHEDULE POLICY](#accn6at_0_collapseThree)

We get it—plans can shift. Here’s how we handle changes to keep the fun (and fairness) rolling:

#### 🛑 Cancellations

- More than 72 hours out? A 30% restocking fee applies.
- Less than 72 hours out? Full payment is required, no exceptions. At that point, your event is packed, prepped, and scheduled

---

#### 🔁 Reschedules (Non-Weather Related)

- Outside 72 hours: You can reschedule with 50% payment up front and no extra fees.
- Inside 72 hours: A 30% restocking fee applies, and we’ll reschedule your event with full payment. Your new date will be completely paid in full.

---

#### 🎡 Carnival & Mechanical Rides

These attractions are rain or shine and cannot be canceled or rescheduled once booked.  
Due to staffing, logistics, and vendor commitments, no refunds or changes are available for these items under any circumstance.

[💨 SAFETY FIRST — WIND IS A BIG DEAL](#accn6at_0_collapseFour)

Our biggest weather concern? Wind.

If gusts hit 20 MPH or higher, inflatables become unsafe to operate—no matter how well they’re staked down.

If you decide to move forward with your event despite the forecast, it’s your responsibility to monitor the weather and deflate the unit immediately (just unplug it) if conditions turn dangerous.

Safety always comes first—no exceptions. ⚠️🌬️

[🎡 MECHANICAL RIDES = FULL PARKING REQUIRED](#accn6at_0_collapseFive)

If your event includes a mechanical, trackless trains or carnival ride, we’ll need space to park the truck and trailer for the entire event, not just setup.  
Many rides stay connected to the trailer during operation (like swings, spinners, etc.). Others—like our trackless trains or Mechanical Bulls—may detach, but still need trailer access nearby.

Got a tricky setup or weird layout? Give us a shout and we’ll help you make a game plan.  
We’re good at navigating—but backing a trailer into a jungle gym isn’t exactly part of the Big Thunder dream. 😄⚡

Customer Reviews  
*Hear what our customers have to say!*

11/8/2014

Great Job.

11/1/2014

This worked out wonderful! We did not have any problems whatsoever. The delivery was actually early, it was fast, and the kids loved it. Customer service was amazing as well!

10/31/2014

Everyone was so friendly!That includes office personnel as well! The guys who made the delivery worked hard at getting the equipment into the gym. They were so patient while we worked to get the bar out of the gym doors so that the mad lab would fit through. I did not hear these guys complain once while doing this. They were also very patient while I had them roll out the mad lab so that I could see how much room it was going to take up. These two guys were awesome! We already have you on the calendar to order from next year. We appreciate Jump Jump Bounce for the great service.
