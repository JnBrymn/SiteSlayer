Customer Reviews
Hear what our customers have to say!

11/8/2014

Great Job.

11/1/2014

This worked out wonderful! We did not have any problems whatsoever. The delivery was actually early, it was fast, and the kids loved it. Customer service was amazing as well!

10/31/2014

Everyone was so friendly!That includes office personnel as well! The guys who made the delivery worked hard at getting the equipment into the gym. They were so patient while we worked to get the bar out of the gym doors so that the mad lab would fit through. I did not hear these guys complain once while doing this. They were also very patient while I had them roll out the mad lab so that I could see how much room it was going to take up. These two guys were awesome! We already have you on the calendar to order from next year. We appreciate Jump Jump Bounce for the great service.

I was very easy to set up the rental online and coordinate the delivery time with the staff. The guy that delivered the slip n slide was very helpful and accommodating especially since we had to search for the power source. This was a great experience and we will use you again for other events.


Set up and tear down jobs were done in a very quick and professional manner. Driver and delivery personnel were very friendly and professional, they deserve a lot of credit for giving the company a great name. Very impressed with their service and with the item we ordered.


The experience with your company was such a positive one we will absolutely be renting for you again. Well done!!

I cancelled my reservation with another company who wanted to nickel and dime me to death over pick up times due to Metro Parks' policy. I was SO grateful to have the dedicated help and service I received from your company and I will certainly use Jump Jump Bounce should I ever want to rent a bouncy house again. The price was fair, the equipment was delivered AND PICKED UP on time, and the employees were beyond friendly!
