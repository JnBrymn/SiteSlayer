## 💡 Need-to-Know Tips:

[Park Event Info](#accn2at_0_collapseOne)

### 📄 Certificate of Insurance (COI)

Does your park require a COI?
Most do—and we’ve got you covered. Just let us know:

- The official name and address of the entity that needs to be listed
- At least 72 hours in advance so we can process the request

💡 We keep COIs on file for many parks—but give us time in case we need a new one!

### ⚡ Power at the Park

Make sure your park space has enough power for the equipment you’re renting.

- Each item’s power needs are listed online
- Some parks have limited outlets—or none at all

💡 Pro Tip: Rent a generator from Big Thunder Events and skip the power stress altogether!

### ⏰ Timing Is Everything

Parks have tight rental windows—and so do we.
Here’s how to keep it smooth:

- Let us know when your park rental starts and ends
- You must be on-site during both setup and pickup
- We need about 1 hour for setup
- Once we return for pickup, you’re free to go—no need to stay afterward

🚫 We cannot leave equipment unattended at parks—your presence is required at both ends of the event.

Have questions or need help coordinating your park setup?
📞 Call us at [866‑246‑5867](tel:866‑246‑5867) or email us: [info@bigthunderevents.com](mailto:info@bigthunderevents.com)

Let’s take your park event to the next level! 🎉⚡

[Backyard Event Info](#accn2at_0_collapseTwo)

### 🛡️ Insurance Matters

Not all rental companies are created equal.
Make sure whoever you rent from carries liability insurance—because accidents can happen, even when you're prepared.
⚠️ Saving a few bucks on Marketplace isn’t worth the risk of a lawsuit.
✅ Good news: Big Thunder Events is fully insured and safety certified.

### ⚡ Power Up

Each inflatable or ride requires specific power—and it must be available within 100 feet of the setup area.
Check the equipment listing for exact power needs.

💡 Pro Tip: Want peace of mind?
Rent a generator from Big Thunder Events and skip the guesswork.

### ☎️ Call Before You Stake: 811

Hosting your event on grass? We use 18"–42" steel stakes for safety—and that means going deep.
✅ Call 811 at least 2–3 business days before your event to mark underground utilities.
It’s free, fast, and could save you from serious (and expensive) damage.

### 💦 Water Party Ready?

Planning to rent a waterslide or splash unit?

- Make sure your hose is long enough to reach from the water source to the back of the setup area
- If you're running multiple water activities, ensure there's enough water pressure and use splitters or extra sources

💡 We don’t provide hoses or splitters—plan ahead to keep the fun flowing!

### ⛅ What If It Rains?

Here’s what that means for you:

- Rides like swings, spinners, and some carnival rides operate directly from the trailer
- Units like the Mechanical Bull or Trackless Train may detach, but still require parking access nearby

✅ You’ll need to reserve space for our truck & trailer to remain for the entire duration of the event

Got a tight layout or funky park entrance?

We’re great at problem-solving... but we’d rather not back into a bounce house or jungle gym 😄⚡

### ⛅ Weather Policy

Rain or shine, mechanical and carnival rides are locked in.
Once booked:

- 🚫 No cancellations
- 🚫 No reschedules

These items require extra planning and coordination, so once they’re on the books—they’re committed.

Frequently Asked Questions | BigThunderEvents.com Nashville TN


# 🎉 Frequently Asked Questions – Big Thunder Events 🎉

## 🎪 Top 5 Things to Look for When Choosing an Inflatable or Carnival Rental

[⚡ Experience That Delivers](#accn23at_0_collapseOne)
Look for a company that’s been tested by time, not just trending.
Big Thunder Events has been serving Middle Tennessee since 2005, handling everything from backyard birthdays to corporate festivals. We’ve seen it all, solved it all, and brought the fun every step of the way.
[🛠️ Licensed, Insured & Professionally Staffed](#accn23at_0_collapseTwo)

Your event deserves more than “guy with a trailer” energy.
We’re a fully licensed and insured company with trained crews and optional staffing for events of all sizes. We even provide operators for mechanical rides and offer full event management if you want to sit back and actually enjoy the day.

[🧠 Planning Help You Can Count On](#accn23at_0_collapseThree)
Events aren’t one-size-fits-all, and neither are we. We’ve been around the block a time or two.
We’ll help match the right units to your age group, space, and vibe—whether you’re planning a preschool water day, a church carnival, or a school-wide field day. Need a full layout plan or help with crowd flow? Just ask.
[💥 A Reputation Built on Results](#accn23at_0_collapseFour)

Great reviews don’t lie. Big Thunder Events is known across Middle Tennessee for on-time setup, professional crews, and events that go off without a hitch. Just ask a local school, church, or PTO—we’ve probably already worked with them.

[🎪 More Than Just Inflatables](#accn23at_0_collapseFive)

A bounce house is fun—but Big Thunder Events brings the full experience.

We offer mechanical rides, obstacle courses, water attractions, interactive games, tents, concessions, generators, and even full event management. Whether you're planning a church carnival, a school field day, or a city-wide festival, we’re your one-stop shop for BIG fun.

Why juggle five vendors when you can get everything from one trusted team?

## 🚚 Booking, Delivery & Setup

[How do I reserve an inflatable or ride?](#accn10at_0_collapseOne)
You can book most inflatables right here on our [website](https://www.bigthunderevents.com/order-by-date/?show_instructions=1)—or give us a call at [(866) 246-5867](tel:(866) 246-5867) to reserve over the phone. [Quotes](https://www.bigthunderevents.com/order-by-date/?show_instructions=1) are always free, but a deposit is required to lock in your date and equipment.

[What areas do you serve?](#accn3at_0_collapseOne)

Big Thunder Events proudly serves Nashville, Murfreesboro, Franklin, Brentwood, Smyrna, and most of Middle Tennessee. If you're within about an hour of Murfreesboro, there's a good chance we deliver to you.

For larger events or full event management, we’re happy to travel further. Please give us a call at [(866) 246-5867](tel:(866) 246-5867) or email us at [info@bigthunderevents.com](mailto:info@bigthunderevents.com?subject=larger%20events%20or%20full%20event%20management) to discuss options.

[Do prices include delivery and setup?](#accn3at_0_collapseTwo)

Our rental prices include professional setup and takedown of your equipment. However, a travel fee is added based on your event location. This covers fuel, crew time, and logistics.

You’ll always receive a detailed quote with all fees included before confirming your reservation—no surprises.

Need a quick estimate? Call us at [(866) 246-5867](tel:(866) 246-5867) and we’ll be happy to help.

[How far in advance should I book?](#accn3at_0_collapseThree)

We recommend booking as early as possible, especially for weekends, school field days, church events, and large festivals.

Spring and summer dates fill up fast, and popular items are often reserved weeks—even months—in advance.
That said, if your event is coming up soon, give us a call—we’ll do our best to make it happen!

📞 [(866) 246-5867](tel:(866) 246-5867) | ✉️ [info@bigthunderevents.com](mailto:info@bigthunderevents.com)

[Can I rent multiple inflatables for one event?](#accn3at_0_collapseFour)

Yes! In fact, many of our clients rent multiple inflatables or attractions for school field days, church festivals, corporate events, and large parties.

We also offer multi-unit discounts for schools, churches, and nonprofits, so you can get more fun for your budget.

Not sure what combos work best together? Give us a call at [(866) 246-5867](tel:(866) 246-5867), and we’ll help you build the perfect event lineup.

[Do you offer attendants or staffing?](#accn3at_0_collapseFive)

Yes! One trained operator is included with any equipment that requires staffing, such as mechanical rides, select interactive games, and specialty attractions.

Need extra hands? Additional staffing is available for an added fee and is subject to availability.

If you truly want to sit back and enjoy the party, ask about our full event management services—we’ll handle setup, staffing, and coordination from start to finish.

📞 [(866) 246-5867](tel:(866) 246-5867) | ✉️ [info@bigthunderevents.com](mailto: info@bigthunderevents.com?subject=Event%20staffing)

## ⚡ Power & Setup Requirements

[What kind of power is required?](#accn14at_0_collapseOne)

Each inflatable requires one or more blowers, and each blower must have its own dedicated 20-amp circuit, not just a separate outlet. Most outlets in homes or parks are linked to the same circuit, so plugging into two nearby plugs could still overload and trip the breaker.

We provide up to 100 feet of commercial-grade extension cord per blower.

Not sure if your setup can handle it? Just ask! Or skip the guesswork and rent one of our [generators](https://www.bigthunderevents.com/items/generator/?ssq=GENERATOR) to keep everything running smoothly.
📞 [(866) 246-5867](tel:(866) 246-5867) | ✉️ [info@bigthunderevents.com](mailto: info@bigthunderevents.com)

[Can you set up on concrete, turf, or indoors?](#accn14at_0_collapseTwo)

Yes! We can set up on grass, turf, concrete, asphalt, gym floors, or indoors. Just let us know your surface type when booking so we can bring the right anchoring equipment (like sandbags or water barrels instead of stakes).

🚫 Please note: We do not set up on gravel, loose rock, or aggregate driveways, as these surfaces can damage the equipment and create safety issues.

Have questions about your setup area? We’ll help you plan a safe and smooth event!

[How much space is needed for setup?](#accn14at_0_collapseThree)

Each inflatable or ride has its own size requirements, but as a general rule, we recommend at least 2 feet of clearance on all sides, including overhead clearance for tall slides or games. You can find exact measurements listed in each unit’s description.

If you’re unsure whether your space will work, just ask!
And don’t forget, we also need room for setup access, especially for larger rides or obstacle courses.

Need help planning your layout? We offer on-site walk-throughs for an additional fee. Or Give us a call or email us and we’ll walk you through the process:
📞[(866) 246-5867](tel:(866) 246-5867) | ✉️ [info@bigthunderevents.com](mailto:info@bigthunderevents.com)

[What power is required for Mechanical/Carnival rides?](#accn14at_0_collapseFour)

We provide power for all mechanical and carnival rides as part of your rental. However, most of these attractions require a 50-amp RV-style outlet to operate safely and reliably.

If your location doesn't have the correct outlet available, don’t worry—we’ll bring a generator setup to power the ride. Our team will go over all power needs with you during the booking process to ensure everything runs smoothly.

📞 Have questions about power access? Give us a call at [(866) 246-5867](tel:(866) 246-5867) or email [info@bigthunderevents.com](mailto:info@bigthunderevents.com) and we’ll walk you through the details.

[what are the Setup & Site Requirements?](#accn14at_0_collapseFive)

To ensure a smooth and safe event, here’s what we need for setup:

✅ Flat, clear space — free of debris, holes, sharp objects, or overhead obstructions (like trees or power lines).
✅ Access to power — most inflatables require a dedicated 20-amp outlet per blower within 100 feet.
✅ Surface type — we can set up on grass, turf, concrete, asphalt, or indoors. Let us know your surface in advance.
🚫 We do not set up on gravel, loose rock, or aggregate driveways.

We also need clear access to the setup area, including gates wide enough for equipment ( four feet minimum) and no tight turns or steep inclines.

Have a tight space or are unsure if your site will work?
We offer on-site walk-throughs for an additional fee and will gladly help you plan your layout.
📞 Call us at [(866) 246-5867](tel:(866) 246-5867) or email [info@bigthunderevents.com](mailto:info@bigthunderevents.com) and we’ll walk you through it!

## ⛅ Weather, Safety & Cancellations

[What if it rains or storms?](#accn16at_0_collapseOne)
Weather can be unpredictable, but we make it easy.
For rescheduling options, safety guidelines, and important policies,
👉 [view our full Weather Policy here](https://www.bigthunderevents.com/policies/) before checkout.
[What is your cancellation policy?](#accn16at_0_collapseTwo)
Need to cancel or reschedule?
We've got clear guidelines to keep things fair for everyone.
👉 [View our full cancellation & weather policy here](https://www.bigthunderevents.com/policies/)
[What happens if something gets damaged?](#accn16at_0_collapseThree)

Want peace of mind?
We offer an optional damage waiver that covers accidental damage from typical use, so you can focus on the fun—not the what-ifs. Ask us about adding it to your rental!

However, if equipment is damaged due to misuse, negligence, or prohibited items (like food, drinks, silly string, or confetti inside inflatables), you may be responsible for cleaning, repair, or replacement costs.

[Do you have insurance?](#accn16at_0_collapseFour)

Yes! Big Thunder Events is fully licensed and insured, including general liability coverage for all our equipment and services.

Need proof of insurance for a school, church, city, or venue? No problem—we’re happy to provide a certificate of insurance (COI) upon request.

📞 Call us at [(866) 246-5867](tel:(866) 246-5867) or email [info@bigthunderevents.com](mailto:info@bigthunderevents.com) to request a copy for your event.

[Will Big Thunder Events ever cancel our event?](#accn16at_0_collapseFive)

We do everything possible to deliver as promised—but safety always comes first.

Big Thunder Events reserves the right to cancel or postpone a rental if conditions are unsafe, including:

- 🌬️ High winds (20+ MPH)
- ⛈️ Severe weather or lightning
- ⚠️ Unsafe setup surfaces (like steep hills or loose gravel)
- 🔌 Power issues or blocked access at the setup site

If we must cancel, we’ll communicate with you directly and do our best to reschedule or credit your event, especially when the issue is something neither of us can control.

Questions about your site or the forecast?
📞 Call us at [(866) 246-5867](tel:(866) 246-5867) or ✉️ email [info@bigthunderevents.com](mailto:info@bigthunderevents.com)—we’re happy to help!

## 🧼 Cleanliness, Age Ranges & Safety

[Is the equipment cleaned between rentals?](#accn18at_0_collapseOne)

Absolutely. At Big Thunder Events, cleanliness and safety are top priorities.

All equipment is thoroughly cleaned, sanitized, and inspected after every rental—no exceptions. We use commercial-grade disinfectants and follow a detailed cleaning checklist to make sure your inflatable or ride arrives fresh, safe, and event-ready every time.

Got questions about our process?
📞 Call [(866) 246-5867](tel:(866) 246-5867) or email [info@bigthunderevents.com](mailto:info@bigthunderevents.com)

[What age groups are your inflatables for?](#accn18at_0_collapseTwo)

We offer inflatables and attractions for all age groups—from toddlers to teens, and even adults for certain rides and obstacle courses.

Each unit is designed with different age ranges in mind, and the majority of our inflatables have a weight limit of 250 lbs per person. This helps ensure safe, balanced fun for all participants.

Whether you’re planning a preschool play day, church youth event, or community festival, we’ll help you choose the right attractions for your crowd.

📞 Call us at [(866) 246-5867](tel:(866) 246-5867) or ✉️ email [info@bigthunderevents.com](mailto:info@bigthunderevents.com)—we’re happy to help you build the perfect lineup.

[Are your rentals safe?](#accn18at_0_collapseThree)

Yes—safety is our top priority at Big Thunder Events.

All of our equipment is inspected, cleaned, and sanitized after every rental, and we follow strict safety protocols during setup. Our inflatables are made from commercial-grade materials and anchored securely using the proper equipment for your surface.

We also provide clear safety rules and operating instructions at delivery, and for larger events, trained staff is available to help oversee certain attractions.

Got questions about setup, supervision, or safety planning?
📞 Call us at [(866) 246-5867](tel:(866) 246-5867) or email [info@bigthunderevents.com](mailto:info@bigthunderevents.com)

[Do you provide safety instructions at delivery?](#accn18at_0_collapseFour)

Yes! Our team will walk you through all safety guidelines, supervision tips, and emergency procedures when we deliver your rental.

We also provide an emailed copy of the rules to keep on-site, so everyone stays informed during your event. If you have any questions, our crew is happy to clarify before they leave.

For larger attractions or mechanical rides, we offer trained staff to stay and monitor the operation if needed.

[Can adults use the inflatables too?](#accn18at_0_collapseFive)

Yes—many of our inflatables are designed for teens and adults, especially larger slides, obstacle courses, and interactive games. Most units have a 250 lb per person weight limit to ensure safety and performance.

👉 Keep in mind: We strongly recommend that kids and adults do not use the same inflatable at the same time. It’s always safer to group participants of similar size and age together.

📞 Need help picking the right setup? Call us at [(866) 246-5867](tel:(866) 246-5867) or email [info@bigthunderevents.com](mailto:info@bigthunderevents.com)—we’ve got you covered.
