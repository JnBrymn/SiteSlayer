Hi Dr. Moore,

I enjoyed browsing Beautiful Smiles—your focus on patient comfort, cosmetic results, and family care really stands out. I noticed how much valuable information you have online about your services, dental concerns, and first visits.

I’m Zac, founder of SlayDigital.ai. We help local practices like yours make site information even easier for patients to access, with a simple, custom web chat agent. It instantly answers common questions by using your existing website content—no added complexity.

Here’s a quick example, using a mock version of your site:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_beautifulsmiles_org  
Just click the chat icon at the bottom-right and type a question—the agent pulls answers directly from your pages.

You can try asking things like:
- What should I expect at my first visit?
- How does your teeth whitening treatment compare to at-home kits?
- Do you offer sedation for patients with dental anxiety?
- What’s involved in getting dental implants?
- How can I schedule an appointment or request a consult?

If you’d like to see how this could help your patients get the answers they need (and lighten your team’s load), just let me know—happy to set up a quick call when it’s convenient.

Best,  
Zac
