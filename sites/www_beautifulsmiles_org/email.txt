SUBJECT: Helping Memphis Patients Get Answers Faster on Your Site

-----------------------------------------

Hi Dr. Moore,

I enjoyed seeing how much you and your team at Beautiful Smiles prioritize comfort and clarity for your Memphis patients – it really shows in your approach and testimonials.

I’m Zac, founder of SlayDigital.ai. We build simple, custom AI web agents that help website visitors get instant, accurate answers using the content you’ve already provided—no extra work required. It’s a great way to cut down on repetitive questions and help patients quickly find what they need.

To show what this could look like for your practice, we set up a mock version of your site here: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_beautifulsmiles_org. There’s a chat icon at the bottom-right—just click it, type a question, and the agent will reply using information from your site.

You can try asking things like:
- How do I schedule an appointment or a consultation?
- What’s the process (and timeline) for getting porcelain veneers?
- Do you offer financial options for dental implants or Invisalign?
- How do you help patients with dental anxiety?
- What should I do in case of a dental emergency?

I’d be glad to hear your thoughts or answer any questions—no pressure at all. If you’re interested in a demo tailored to your patients’ needs, just let me know.

Best regards,  
Zac
