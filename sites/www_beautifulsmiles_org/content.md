# Memphis General Dentistry Services

Beautiful smiles start with great oral hygiene, including routine visits to the dentist. We offer a variety of general dentistry services to accommodate basic dental needs. Our general dentistry services improve and sustain the health of your teeth, gums, and overall oral health. The general dentistry services our office provides include:

### Dental Checkups & Cleanings

Great oral hygiene begins with a consistent and healthy routine. We recommend visiting the dentist at least once per year for x-rays, dental cleanings, cavity prevention, and oral cancer screenings, but more often if you’re able.

[Dental Checkups and Cleanings  →](https://www.beautifulsmiles.org/oral-hygiene-and-products)

### Advanced Periodontal Care

Did you know gum disease affects 75% of the U.S. population? Our team is trained to identify and treat gingivitis and periodontitis to help restore your gums and overall oral health through a variety of treatments. We also provide advanced dental care for our diabetic patients and those with periodontal disease in the form of more frequent cleaning options to help prevent gum disease, decay, and infection.

[Advanced Periodontal Care  →](https://www.beautifulsmiles.org/advanced-periodontal-care)

### Tooth-Colored Fillings

Tooth-colored fillings are an easy way to restore fractured teeth, close gaps, and improve your smile. In one short appointment, our team can replace your old metal fillings with new tooth-colored fillings for a new and improved smile.

[Tooth-Colored Fillings  →](https://www.beautifulsmiles.org/tooth-colored-fillings)

### Root Canals

If you have an inflamed or infected pulp of a tooth, you are probably in need of a root canal. During a root canal treatment, the pulp of the infected tooth will be removed and sealed to prevent bacteria from infecting the tooth aain.

[Root Canals  →](https://www.beautifulsmiles.org/root-canal)

### Tooth Extraction

Whether your teeth have been damaged by an injury or gum disease, the surrounding gum and bone can become infected, resulting in the need for tooth extraction. Tooth extraction is made easy in our office through sedation dentistry.

[Tooth Extractions  →](https://www.beautifulsmiles.org/tooth-extraction)

### Dental Crowns

For damaged and/or decayed teeth, tooth-colored dental crowns could be the solution. Whether you’re looking to restore tooth functionality or improve your smile, dental crowns can do the job.

[Dental Crowns  →](https://www.beautifulsmiles.org/dental-crowns)

### Night Guards

If you are experiencing jaw pain, chronic headaches, or TMJ pain, you could be suffering from bruxism, also known as teeth grinding. One possible solution to alleviate your pain is investing in night guards.

[Night Guards  →](https://www.beautifulsmiles.org/night-guards)

Porcelain Veneers in Memphis, TN | Cosmetic Dentistry | Beautiful Smiles


# Porcelain Veneers in Memphis, TN

Veneers are extremely thin, yet durable shells that are customized just for your smile. Made of porcelain, the veneers are made of tooth-colored materials that seamlessly cover the surface of your teeth, dramatically improving their appearance. With the help of porcelain veneers, teeth are quickly transformed, with changes that improve the color, shape, size, length, and alignment of each tooth.

Porcelain veneers are among the most common form of dental veneers. The porcelain material is not only more stain resistant, but porcelain also has light-reflecting properties that make it virtually indiscernible from natural teeth. [View our Smile Gallery](https://www.beautifulsmiles.org/before-and-after), which has many examples of patients’ before and after photos with their new veneers. To find out if veneers are right for you, learn more below and request an appointment with Dr. Moore.

[Request a Consultation](/schedule-appointment)

## Should I Get Porcelain Veneers?

Have you ever wanted a perfect smile, but wanted results without long-term orthodontic care, teeth whitening, and more? Porcelain veneers may be the right choice for you. Porcelain veneers are common among patients who seek to fix:

- Teeth that are discolored, whether from a root canal treatment, stains from tetracycline or other drugs, excessive fluoride, or the presence of large resin fillings that have changed the color of the tooth
- Teeth that are worn down
- Teeth that are chipped or broken
- Teeth that are misaligned, uneven, or irregularly shaped
- Teeth with significant gaps between them

## What are the steps for getting dental veneers?

The procedure for getting dental veneers usually requires at least three trips to Dr. Moore’s office, one for your initial consultation and two to customize and apply your veneers.

Step 1: Diagnosis and Treatment Planning

This first visit includes your consultation with Dr. Moore. While Dr. Moore will be examining your smile, you also need to come prepared for this portion. Be ready to explain to Dr. Moore what results you are trying to achieve for your smile, along with any other treatments you have considered.

During this appointment, Dr. Moore will see if veneers are right for you, will discuss the full procedure, and tell you more about life with porcelain veneers. If you are a good candidate for veneers, Dr. Moore may also do some preliminary work like make impressions of your mouth and teeth or take x-rays.

Step 2: Preparation

Once you have been approved for porcelain veneers, it is time to get started! This second appointment will involve preparing the tooth for veneers. Dr. Moore will remove about a half millimeter of enamel – roughly the thickness of the veneer – from the tooth surface. If you choose to do so, Dr. Moore can use a local anesthetic to help numb your teeth during the procedure.

Next, Dr. Moore will take an impression of your teeth. This model will be sent to the dental laboratory, which will construct veneers that are fit exactly for your smile. It usually takes 1-2 weeks for Dr. Moore to receive the final porcelain veneers; until then, you may be able to have temporary veneers put on, if necessary.

Step 3: Bonding

Once your veneers arrive from the lab, Dr. Moore is ready to bond them permanently to your teeth. To prepare your tooth for its veneer, Dr. Moore will clean, polish, and etch the tooth, allowing it to be clean but also roughened a bit to create a strong bond for the porcelain veneer.

A bonding cement is applied to the veneer, then the veneer is carefully placed onto your tooth. Once properly positioned, Dr. Moore will apply a light beam to the veneer, which activates the chemicals in the cement to harden very quickly. Finally, Dr. Moore will remove any excess cement, evaluate your bite, and make adjustments to the veneer as necessary. Now, all you have to do is smile: you have beautiful new porcelain veneers!

Next Steps

Now that the dental veneer process is complete, Dr. Moore may ask you to return for a follow-up visit in the next few weeks to check on you. Dr. Moore will want to see how your gums are responding to the presence of a porcelain veneer, to check the veneer’s placement, and to see how you are doing following the procedure.

Invisalign® | Invisalign in Memphis, TN | Cosmetic Dentistry


# Invisalign® or Clear Braces

Have you always wanted a straight smile, but you are in need of a solution that is both discreet and effective? Invisalign uses a series of invisible, removable, and comfortable aligners that adjust the form of your smile over time. Unlike traditional metal braces, Invisalign is a flexible option that conforms to your lifestyle – not the other way around. Invisalign is made with 3-D computer imaging technology, and is offered by the top dentists and orthodontists across the US and Canada. This highly popular and successful treatment is offered to teenagers and adults seeking to straighten their smiles.

99% of our patients qualify for Invisalign.

Thanks to the advancements in Invisalign technology, along with our skilled staff’s experience with this treatment, our patients are getting amazing results. To see if Invisalign is the solution for you, request a consultation with Dr. Moore today.


## Why choose Invisalign over braces?

Invisalign has increased in popularity for many reasons. Here are some of the most important points:

- Invisalign is removable; simply remove the aligners to eat, drink, brush, and floss
- Invisalign is comfortable; the smooth aligners are unlike the metal wires that can poke your mouth and cause abrasions and sores
- Invisalign is nearly invisible; the clear aligners are difficult to see, making your treatment discreet
- Invisalign is following a plan; with Invisalign’s technology, you can follow your own virtual treatment plan to see how straight your teeth will become through your treatment
- Invisalign is flexible; live your life as you wish! Unlike braces, aligners won’t keep you from doing the things you love

## How does Invisalign work?

You wear each set of aligners for about 2 weeks, removing them only to eat, drink, brush, and floss. As you replace each aligner with the next in the series, your teeth will move – little by little, week by week – until they have straightened to the final position Dr. Moore has prescribed. You'll continue to visit Dr. Moore to ensure that your treatment is progressing as planned.

Total treatment time depends on individual needs and the average number of aligners worn during treatment.

# Dental Implants in Memphis, TN

## What are dental implants?

Dental implants are essentially artificial teeth that are used to replace missing teeth in order to regain function and prevent bone loss and infection. Additionally, dental implants are great for those who are self-conscious about their smile following an [extraction](https://www.beautifulsmiles.org/tooth-extraction) or tooth loss. With dental implants, we can both enhance your smile’s natural beauty and protect your health.


## How do dental implants work?

Dental implants are placed in the bone, in the same area where the toot root once was. Once the dental implant and bone have fused together, an abutment and crown are attached to the dental implant. The fusing, or integration process, takes anywhere from four to six months. After the abutment and tooth are placed on the dental implant it will appear and function like any other tooth.

## Are dental implants painful?

During the implant placement, anesthesia is used, so you shouldn’t feel any pain, but as with any dental procedure, dental implant treatment can lead to soreness and sensitivity for a short time after the procedure.

### Where can I get dental implants in Memphis?

Protecting the health of our patients is at the core of our mission at Memphis Center for Family & Cosmetic Dentistry. Dr. Miles Moore is a trusted and experienced dentist with extensive training in dental implant treatment. If you’re wanting the best tooth replacement option or ready to enhance the appearance of your smile, [request an appointment](https://www.beautifulsmiles.org/schedule-appointment) with Dr. Moore and the team at Memphis Center for Cosmetic Dentistry today.

## How much do dental implants cost?

The cost of dental implants varies by patient. The need for bone grafting, which is determined by your existing bone structure and the number of implants needed will influence the dental implant cost.

[OUR FINANCIAL OPTIONS](/financial-options)

## What are the advantages of dental implants?

There are many advantages to dental implants, including:

- Improved appearance. Dental implants look and feel like your own teeth, and because they are designed to fuse with bone, they become permanent.
- Improved speech. With poor-fitting dentures, the teeth can slip within the mouth causing you to mumble or slur your words. Dental implants allow you to speak without the worry that teeth might slip.
- Improved comfort. Because they become part of you, implants eliminate the discomfort of removable dentures.
- Easier eating. Sliding dentures can make chewing difficult. Dental implants function like your own teeth, allowing you to eat your favorite foods with confidence and without pain.
- Improved self-esteem. Dental implants can give you back your smile and help you feel better about yourself.
- Improved oral health. Dental implants don't require reducing other teeth, as a tooth-supported bridge does. Because nearby teeth are not altered to support the implant, more of your own teeth are left intact, improving long-term oral health. Individual implants also allow easier access between teeth, improving oral hygiene.
- Durability. Implants are very durable and will last many years. With good care, many implants last a lifetime.
- Convenience. Removable dentures are just that; removable. Dental implants eliminate the embarrassing inconvenience of removing dentures, as well as the need for messy adhesives to keep them in place.

The Best Products for Sensitive Teeth
If you have sensitive teeth, then you know that eating, drinking, or even being in the wrong environment can be a literal pain.  Tooth sensitivity is a sharp, sudden pain brought on most commonly by consuming your favorite foods (like ice cream) or drinking a hot cup of your preferred morning time brew.  It occurs when certain stimuli reach the roots of your teeth, causing that familiar stab of discomfort.  Ouch!
