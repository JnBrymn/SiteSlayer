- [Dental Implants Chicago: A Complete Guide to Tooth Replacement](#dental-implants-chicago-a-complete-guide-to-tooth-replacement)

## Dental Implants Chicago: A Complete Guide to Tooth Replacement

Dental implants are one of the best solutions for replacing missing or failing teeth. They not only mimic the function of natural teeth, allowing for comfortable eating and speaking, but also help preserve the jawbone and support facial structure, preventing the deterioration that often accompanies tooth loss. Patients seeking a permanent tooth replacement solution find that dental implants offer both functional and aesthetic benefits that dentures cannot match.

The process of getting dental implants starts with a detailed consultation to determine if they are the right option for you, considering factors like jawbone development, smoking habits, and overall oral health. In Illinois, the average cost for the complete implant procedure is about $4,400, but the [Dental Group of Chicago](/) offers it for $2,595, making high-quality dental expertise more accessible. Our comprehensive approach, utilizing advanced technology and high-quality materials, ensures the longevity and success of the implant, which boasts a success rate of over 95%, making it a wise long-term investment for restoring both the functionality and beauty of your smile.

## Who Is a Candidate for Dental Implants?

Dental implants are an effective solution for most patients interested in replacing missing teeth or damaged teeth. However, not all patients are suitable candidates for this procedure. Ideal candidates for dental implants typically include:

- Adults with Fully Developed Jawbones: All types of dental implants ([single tooth](/dental-implants/single-tooth-dental-implants/) or [All-on-4](/dental-implants/all-on-4/)) require a mature jawbone for successful placement, making them more suitable for adults whose jawbones have fully developed.
- Non-Smokers: Smoking can inhibit healing in the mouth, making it more difficult for the implant to integrate with the jawbone successfully.
- Adequate Bone Density: Sufficient bone in the jaw is needed to support the implant. People who have experienced bone loss may require bone grafts before proceeding with implants.
- Individuals with Good Oral Health: Healthy gums, free of gum disease, are required for this procedure. Gum health plays an essential role in the success of implant surgery.
- People without Certain Health Conditions: Chronic disorders, such as uncontrolled diabetes or heart disease, may affect healing and make surgery more risky.

If you are considering dental implants Chicago, a consultation with the Dental Group of Chicago can help determine if they are the right option for you. [Our doctor and team](https://dentalgroupofchicago.com/meet-our-doctors/) can assess your oral health, discuss your medical history, and recommend the best course of action to achieve a functional and aesthetically pleasing result. Schedule an appointment at our office to learn more about how we can help you achieve your new smile.

### Average Costs of Dental Implants in Illinois

The typical price for a dental implant, including the abutment and crown, across Illinois is approximately $4,400. However, at the Dental Group of Chicago, we offer the same comprehensive package for just $2,595. This means choosing us for your dental implant needs could save you an impressive $1,805 compared to other dental practices!

As the leading affordable option in Chicago, IL, the Dental Group of Chicago is committed to helping you replace missing teeth and achieve the smile you’ve always wanted. We provide high-quality dentistry at a price that makes accessibility a priority.

## What Is the Process for Getting a Dental Implant?

Proceeding with a dental implant involves several steps, each important to ensuring the success and longevity of the implant. The following is a general overview of the process:

1. Initial Consultation: Your dentist at the Dental Group of Chicago will thoroughly examine your oral health. This includes dental X-rays and possibly a CT scan using advanced imaging to assess bone quality and determine the precise placement of the implant.
2. Treatment Planning: Then, we will create a treatment plan based on your goals and needs. We consider factors such as the number of teeth to be replaced and the condition of your jawbone.
3. Preparatory Procedures: If necessary, preparatory procedures such as tooth extraction or bone grafting are performed to ensure the jawbone is capable of supporting the implant. Sedation options are available to ensure your comfort during these procedures.
4. Implant Placement: Under local anesthesia or general anesthesia depending on your case, the titanium implant is surgically placed into the jawbone by our experienced surgeon. The area is then allowed to heal, and the implant integrates with the bone, which may take several months. This surgical procedure is performed with precision to minimize discomfort.
5. Abutment Attachment: Once the implant has merged with the jawbone, a second minor surgery might be needed to attach the abutment, which serves as the base for the new tooth. A temporary crown may be placed during healing. After the abutment is secure, the gum tissue is allowed some time to heal.
6. Placing the Prosthetic Tooth: After your gums heal, you’ll return to your dentist to get the prosthetic tooth (crown) attached as your final restoration. We take impressions of your mouth and remaining teeth to create a replacement tooth that perfectly matches your existing teeth in shape, color, and appearance.
7. Follow-Up and Maintenance: After the crown is placed and your treatment is completed, we will schedule follow-ups to ensure the implant is functioning well and to check on your oral hygiene. Routine dental check-ups and proper care are essential to support the health of the implant and surrounding teeth.

For any questions or concerns regarding this process, speak with the dental professionals at the Dental Group of Chicago today.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Dental Implants

### How long do dental implants last?

With proper care and maintenance, dental implants can last 20-30 years or even a lifetime. The titanium post that’s placed in your jawbone is designed to be permanent, while the crown on top may need replacement after 10-15 years due to normal wear. Regular dental check-ups, good oral hygiene, and avoiding habits like smoking significantly extend the life of your implant. At the Dental Group of Chicago, we provide thorough aftercare instructions to help maximize the longevity of your restoration.

### Can I get dental implants in a single appointment?

While some preparatory work can be done quickly, the complete dental implant process typically requires multiple visits over several months. The implant post needs time to fuse with your jawbone (osseointegration), which usually takes 3-6 months. However, we can often place a temporary tooth on the same day as implant placement so you don’t have gaps in your smile. Some patients may qualify for same-day implant procedures depending on their bone quality and overall oral health.

### Is dental implant surgery painful?

Most patients report minimal discomfort during and after the procedure. Local anesthesia or general anesthesia ensures you feel no pain during surgery. Afterward, any soreness is typically manageable with over-the-counter pain medication and usually subsides within a few days. Many patients find that getting a dental implant is less uncomfortable than a tooth extraction. Our team at the Dental Group of Chicago prioritizes your comfort throughout the entire process.

### What’s the difference between dental implants and dentures?

Dental implants are permanent fixtures that are surgically anchored into your jawbone, functioning like natural teeth roots. They prevent bone loss and don’t require adhesives or removal for cleaning. Dentures, on the other hand, are removable appliances that sit on top of your gums. While dentures are initially less expensive, dental implants offer superior stability, comfort, and longevity. Implants also help preserve your facial structure and prevent the sunken appearance that can occur with long-term denture use.

### Will insurance cover my dental implants?

Coverage varies by insurance plan. While many dental insurance plans classify dental implants as a cosmetic procedure, some plans offer partial coverage, especially if the tooth loss resulted from an accident or medical condition. The Dental Group of Chicago works with various insurance providers and can help you understand your benefits. We also offer affordable pricing at $2,595 for the complete implant package, making this treatment accessible regardless of insurance coverage. Contact our office to discuss payment options during your consultation.

All-On-4 Dental Implants South Loop, Chicago | Dental Group of Chicago Have Insurance? Ask Us About a Free Cleaning!


# All-On-4 Dental Implants in Chicago, IL


- [All-On-4 Dental Implants](#all-on-4-dental-implants)

## All-On-4 Dental Implants

All-on-4 implants are full-arch tooth replacements designed for individuals who have lost most or all of their teeth or those who are on the brink of needing [complete dentures](/general-dentistry/denture/). This dental procedure offers an effective, permanent solution that can transform lives.

Whether you are considering a long-term solution to denture discomfort or seeking to reclaim the functionality and confidence that comes with natural teeth, All-on-4 dental implants in South Loop, Chicago, are efficient and cost-effective. From the initial consultation to the placement of the prosthetic teeth, the [dental professionals](https://dentalgroupofchicago.com/meet-our-doctors/) at the Dental Group of Chicago will guide you through the entire process, helping you obtain the restored smile you dream of.

## What Are All-on-4 Dental Implants?

The All-on-4 technique utilizes a minimum of four strategically placed implants in the jaw, and these implants are a stable base for supporting a full arch of prosthetic teeth.

What makes All-on-4 unique is the angle at which the posterior implants are placed. The implants are typically angled about 30 to 45 degrees from the bite plane, which allows for increased contact by using the natural support of the bone, even in patients with diminished bone density, without requiring bone grafting.

This is particularly advantageous because it significantly reduces the overall treatment and recovery time when compared to traditional methods that often require more implants and extensive bone grafting. The [other benefits](/benefits-choosing-all-on-4-dental-implants-over-traditional-dentures/) of this procedure include the following:

- Efficiency: The procedure generally requires only one surgery to insert the four implants and attach a provisional set of teeth, providing immediate function and aesthetic improvement.
- Cost-Effectiveness: Because it often eliminates the need for bone grafts and uses fewer implants, the All-on-4 procedure can be less expensive than traditional [full-mouth dental implants](/dental-implants/).
- Recovery Time: The minimally invasive nature of the surgery allows for a shorter and less uncomfortable recovery period.
- Long-Term Durability: All-on-4 implants are a long-lasting solution. With proper care, the implant system can last a lifetime, mimicking the strength and function of natural teeth.

The procedure provides a fixed, stable solution for missing teeth with a look and feel that is incredibly close to natural teeth, boosting both the functional capabilities and your confidence.

## Are You a Candidate for All-on-4 Dental Implants in South Loop, Chicago?

Deciding whether All-on-4 dental implants are right for you involves evaluating several key factors related to your oral health and overall wellness. The following is a guide to help determine if you might be an ideal candidate for this dental procedure:

### Adequate Jawbone Structure

While All-on-4 implants are designed to minimize the need for bone grafting by taking advantage of the existing bone, a basic level of jawbone density and volume is still required. Your dentist will perform detailed imaging studies to assess your jawbone’s condition. If you have moderate bone loss, the strategic placement and angling of the implants may still make this procedure a viable option.

### Good Overall Health

Successful implant surgery depends largely on your body’s ability to heal properly. Ideal candidates for All-on-4 implants are generally in good health. Chronic conditions, such as diabetes or heart disease, should be well-managed.

### Non-Smokers or Willing to Quit

Smoking significantly impairs healing in the mouth, increasing the risk of implant failure. If you smoke, you should quit or at least be willing to stop prior to and throughout the healing process to improve your surgical outcomes.

### Looking for a Long-Term Solution

Candidates should be seeking a permanent solution to tooth loss. These implants are designed to be a long-lasting treatment, providing an alternative to dentures that is more fixed and feels more like natural teeth.

### Current Denture Users

Individuals who are already using dentures and are unsatisfied with the comfort, function, or fit of their current dentures are excellent candidates. These implants are a more stable and comfortable solution, allowing you to eat, speak, and smile with more confidence.

### Sufficient Commitment to Oral Hygiene

All-on-4 implants require the same diligent care as natural teeth, including regular brushing, flossing, and visits to the dentist. Candidates need to be committed to maintaining good oral hygiene to support the longevity of their implants.

### Evaluation by a Dental Professional

An evaluation by the dental professionals at The Dental Group of Chicago is the final step in determining if All-on-4 dental implants are suitable for you. This includes considering your current oral health, your medical history, your expectations, and lifestyle needs.

Consulting with the dental professionals at the Dental Group of Chicago will help you understand your options and the best course of action for your specific situation.

## What Is the Process of Getting All-on-4 Dental Implants?

The process of getting All-on-4 dental implants involves several steps, including:

### Implant Consultation

During your implant consultation, your dentist at the Dental Group of Chicago will review your medical and dental histories, conduct a full oral examination, and use imaging techniques such as X-rays or CT scans to assess the density and volume of your jawbone. This is also the time for you to discuss your expectations and any concerns you may have.

### Treatment Plan

We will create a personalized All-on-4 treatment plan and determine the best placement for the four implants to maximize the use of available bone and plan for the prosthetic teeth that will be attached to these implants. This phase may involve collaboration with other dental professionals to ensure all aspects of the procedure are carefully

### Surgical Procedure

The actual implant surgery is usually completed in a single day. Under local anesthesia or sedation, we will place the four implants in your jawbone – two near the front of your mouth and two at the back, angled to take full advantage of existing bone structure. After the implants are in place, temporary teeth are often attached, providing function and aesthetics until the final prosthesis is ready.

### Healing and Integration

During this phase, which can last several months, the implants fuse with the jawbone to make a foundation for your new teeth. You need to follow a modified diet and adhere to specific oral hygiene practices to ensure successful healing.

### Placement of Permanent Prosthesis

Once your implants have fully integrated with your jawbone, you will return to the dentist to have your permanent prosthetic teeth fitted. These teeth are custom-made to match the natural color, shape, and alignment of your smile. This step might require several visits to fine-tune the fit and function of the prosthesis.

### Follow-Up Care and Maintenance

Follow-up visits are necessary to monitor the implants and the health of your surrounding tissues. We will check the stability of the implants, the condition of the prosthesis, and ensure your bite is functioning properly.

Implant placement in the All-on-4 technique involves strategically positioning four dental implants in the jawbone to support a full arch of replacement teeth. Two implants are placed vertically near the front of the jaw where bone density is typically stronger, while two posterior implants are angled at 30 to 45 degrees. This careful positioning of axial and tilted implants maximizes contact with existing bone and avoids critical anatomical structures, allowing for successful tooth replacement even in patients with reduced bone density without requiring extensive bone grafting procedures.

### What role does oral and maxillofacial surgery play in getting All-on-4 implants?

Oral and maxillofacial surgery is the foundation of successful All-on-4 implant treatment, as these surgeons possess advanced training in clinical implant dentistry and complex jaw procedures. They carefully assess anatomical structures through detailed imaging to create a personalized treatment plan for each patient. During the surgical procedure, they precisely place both axial and tilted implants into the jawbone while ensuring proper angulation and positioning. This surgical precision is essential for replacing missing teeth effectively and establishing a stable foundation for the fixed prosthesis to restore both function and appearance.

### How do tilted implants differ from traditional vertical implants in All-on-4 treatment?

Tilted implants are positioned at angles between 30 to 45 degrees, while traditional vertical implants are placed straight into the jawbone. The strategic use of tilted implants in the posterior jaw allows for increased contact with the bone surrounding the implant site and helps avoid important anatomical structures. This angled approach is particularly beneficial for patients with bone loss, as it maximizes the use of existing bone without grafting. Both axial and tilted implants work together to create a stable base for the fixed prosthesis, effectively replacing the function of natural tooth roots.

### Can All-on-4 implants replace damaged teeth and restore full mouth function?

All-on-4 implants provide an effective solution for replacing missing teeth or severely damaged teeth by serving as artificial tooth roots that support a complete arch of prosthetic teeth. After a thorough evaluation of your oral health and anatomical structures, the dental team develops a personalized treatment plan for implant placement. The procedure utilizes both axial and tilted implants to create a strong foundation that integrates with the bone surrounding each implant. Once healing is complete, a custom fixed prosthesis is attached, restoring full chewing ability, speech, and confidence in your smile.

### What makes a personalized treatment plan important in clinical implant dentistry?

A personalized treatment plan in clinical implant dentistry ensures the All-on-4 procedure addresses your specific oral health needs, jawbone condition, and aesthetic goals. Your dentist evaluates anatomical structures through advanced imaging to determine optimal positioning for both axial and tilted implants, maximizing the use of existing bone while protecting vital structures. The treatment plan accounts for your current tooth condition, whether replacing missing teeth or removing damaged teeth, and designs a fixed prosthesis that matches your natural appearance. This customized approach considers how the bone surrounding each implant will support long-term function, ensuring successful integration of the artificial tooth roots.

# Invisalign South Loop, Chicago, IL

- [Invisalign](#invisalign)

## Invisalign

Invisalign® straightens your teeth just as effectively as traditional metal braces but instead uses a modern approach that is best suited for an active and social lifestyle. The clear plastic aligners are virtually invisible, so no one has to know they are there. And unlike traditional braces, the invisible aligners are removable! This makes it possible to brush and floss your teeth without the interference of brackets that can contribute to tooth decay. You can pop these invisible braces out to eat and drink whatever you like with no food restrictions.

Traditional braces use wires and metal that can poke and irritate your gums, but Invisalign® is made of smooth plastic that is comfortable to wear. The convenience of this South Loop, Chicago Invisalign® treatment is that it appeals to people in all stages of life. Schedule a consultation with the Dental Group of Chicago if you are ready to improve your smile.

## What Is the Process of Getting Invisalign?

Invisalign® effectively corrects a wide variety of dental problems, including teeth that are widely gapped, overly crowded, or somewhere in between. This treatment begins with a consultation with a dentist to determine if you are a good candidate and to answer all of your questions. Not all dentists or orthodontists work with Invisalign®. However, the Dental Group of Chicago are specially trained providers who will develop an individualized treatment plan for your best results.

We’ll start with X-rays and impressions of your teeth to create a 3D image. Using this, we can map out the exact movements of your teeth and create a virtual image of how your teeth will look. Based on your individualized plan, a series of custom-made, clear aligners are made specifically for you. The aligners are made of BPA-free clear plastic and fit easily over your teeth. They are smooth and should be comfortable to wear.

About every two weeks, you will begin wearing a new set of aligners, which will progress you through to your treatment goals. To make sure things are going well, you will have a check-up in the office every six weeks or so to monitor your progress.

## How Much Does Invisalign® Cost?

Many people assume that clear aligners cost more than metal braces, so you may be surprised to hear that Invisalign® is generally no more expensive than traditional braces. The primary factors that determine the cost of treatment include the severity of the issues that you want corrected and the length of your treatment.

### Will My Insurance Cover Invisalign®?

Many dental insurance policies do cover Invisalign® treatment. If your insurance covers orthodontic care, it may also cover Invisalign®. In fact, many plans cover as much as $3500 toward Invisalign® treatment. In addition to your traditional dental insurance policy, Flexible Spending Account (FSA) funds can also be used for Invisalign®, and we offer flexible and affordable monthly payment plan options to address any remaining financial concerns.

### Are There Any Other Cost Considerations?

Because Invisalign® uses a series of invisible, removable aligners, it has little impact on your appearance and lifestyle, allowing you to freely pursue professional and personal goals without hindrance. With clear braces, you can straighten your teeth in a way that is both comfortable and allows you to feel confident at home and at work.

## Invisalign® Advantages

Invisalign®  treatment offers the following advantages:

- Invisalign® works with your schedule. There is minimal time required in our office for treatment as there are no wires and brackets to fix.
- You can keep up with your traditional oral health routine. Traditional braces often cause tooth decay around the brackets because it’s hard to floss and brush, especially between teeth. Invisalign® allows you to completely remove your aligners for easy and thorough cleaning.
- You can occasionally remove them to enjoy a special night out. Life happens, and you want to have the chance to look your best when you need it!
- You can eat or drink whatever you would like. With Invisalign®, there is no risk of breakage or loosening of wires while you are enjoying crunchy or sticky foods. No stress at meal and snack times.
- You can feel like yourself. No need to hide your smile or worry that food is caught in your braces. With Invisalign®, you can feel confident in knowing that you look good and that your breath is fresh.
- You can see what your teeth will look like before you even begin. With Invisalign® advanced 3D imaging computer technology, you can get a sneak peek at what your teeth will look like during each phase of treatment, all the way to the final dazzling result!
- It’s comfortable. Aligners are made of smooth plastic that is custom-made for your teeth. There is no risk of poking, bleeding, or irritation when you participate in sports or play a musical instrument.
- Invisalign® is affordable and may be covered by your dental insurance.

Invisalign® has all of these advantages for the same cost as traditional braces!

## Frequently Asked Questions about Invisalign Aligners in Chicago, IL

### How do clear aligners Invisalign work differently from traditional braces for crowded teeth?

Clear aligners Invisalign use a series of custom-made, transparent plastic trays that gradually move your teeth into proper position. Unlike traditional braces with metal brackets and wires, these removable aligners are virtually invisible and can be taken out for eating, drinking, and cleaning. For crowded teeth specifically, each aligner applies gentle pressure to guide teeth into their correct positions over time, making the treatment process more comfortable and aesthetically pleasing.

### What qualifications should I look for when choosing an Invisalign doctor?

When choosing an Invisalign doctor, look for a dental professional who is specifically trained and certified as an Invisalign provider. The best candidates have extensive experience with orthodontic issues and have completed advanced training in align technology. Your Invisalign doctor should be able to show before-and-after cases, explain the treatment process thoroughly, and have a proven track record of successful teeth straightening outcomes. Always verify their credentials and ask about their experience with cases similar to yours.

### Can Invisalign treatment help prevent gum disease while straightening teeth?

Yes, Invisalign can actually help reduce the risk of gum disease during your teeth straightening process. Because the aligners are removable, you can maintain excellent oral hygiene by brushing and flossing normally, unlike traditional braces where food particles can get trapped around brackets. Properly aligned teeth are also easier to clean long-term, reducing bacteria buildup that leads to gum disease. However, it’s crucial to clean your aligners regularly and maintain good oral hygiene throughout your Invisalign journey.

### Will my teeth shift back after completing my Invisalign journey?

Some degree of teeth shift is natural after any orthodontic treatment, which is why retention is crucial for maintaining your straighter teeth results. Your Invisalign doctor will provide you with retainers to wear after treatment completion, typically at night initially, then as recommended for long-term maintenance. Following your orthodontist’s retention protocol is essential to prevent significant shifting and preserve your investment in achieving properly aligned teeth through your Invisalign treatment.

### Can Invisalign address complex bite issues and other orthodontic issues?

Modern Invisalign technology has advanced significantly and can now treat many complex orthodontic issues, including various bite problems like overbites, underbites, and crossbites. However, the suitability depends on the severity of your specific bite issues. Your Invisalign doctor will conduct a thorough evaluation using 3D imaging to determine if Invisalign is appropriate for your case. Some extremely complex orthodontic issues may still require traditional braces or additional treatments, but many patients find Invisalign suitable for their needs.

## General Dentistry

As a busy professional, you probably juggle work deadlines, family responsibilities, and personal commitments. Because of this, finding time for dental care often gets pushed to the bottom of your to-do list. Unfortunately, when dental problems finally demand attention, they’ve usually progressed beyond simple prevention into costly, time-consuming treatments that could have been avoided with regular care. That’s where we come into play!

At Dental Group of Chicago, we specialize in providing complete general dentistry services to working professionals and families in the South Loop area. Our team of experienced dentists understands that maintaining your oral health shouldn’t disrupt your work schedule or family commitments, which is why we offer extended weekday hours, as well as Saturday appointments to ensure you and your family get the dental care you deserve.

## What Is General Dentistry?

General dentistry is the most foundational branch of your oral health care. These essential dental services focus on preventing, diagnosing, and treating common dental problems before they develop into more serious issues that require extensive treatment. Think of your general dentist as the primary care physician for your mouth; the first line of defense against dental problems and your partner in maintaining lifelong oral health.

Our comprehensive general dentistry services include routine cleaning, dental exams, fillings, restorations, and preventive treatments. We also handle dental emergencies because we understand that tooth pain doesn’t follow a 9-to-5 schedule. When you’re experiencing discomfort, our team is here to provide swift and effective care, helping you return to your daily routine.

## Preventive Care to Protect Your Oral Health

Prevention truly is the best medicine when it comes to your oral health. Regular dental cleaning and exams biannually can help you avoid costly, invasive procedures down the line. During these appointments, our skilled hygienists remove plaque and tartar buildup that regular brushing and flossing can’t eliminate. Our practice also performs comprehensive exams and oral cancer screenings to catch potential issues early when they’re easier and less expensive to treat. This thorough cleaning process helps prevent gum disease and keeps your smile healthy.

Our preventive approach extends beyond your appointments. We provide targeted guidance on proper brushing and flossing techniques, recommend appropriate oral care products, and discuss lifestyle factors that affect your oral health. This educational component helps you maintain optimal oral health between visits and addresses any concerns you may have about your dental needs.

## Restorative Treatments That Preserve Your Smile

Even with excellent preventive care, restorative treatment may sometimes be necessary. Our general dentistry services include several options to restore damaged teeth and maintain the function and appearance of your smile.

### Fillings

Dental fillings are one of the most common restorative treatments we perform. When cavities develop, we remove the decayed portion of the tooth and fill the space with durable materials that blend naturally with your teeth. Modern filling materials are designed to withstand the forces of chewing while maintaining a natural appearance and texture.

### Inlays & Onlays

For teeth that need more restoration than a filling can provide but don’t require a full crown, inlays and onlays offer an excellent middle-ground solution. These puzzle-piece restorations are crafted in a dental lab and bonded to your tooth, providing superior strength and durability compared to traditional fillings.

Inlays fit within the cusps of your tooth, while onlays extend over one or more cusps. Both options save more of your natural tooth structure than crowns while still providing excellent protection against further decay.

### Crowns & Bridges

Crowns are an ideal choice to strengthen teeth with large cavities when there isn’t enough healthy tooth structure to hold a filling. They can also protect weakened teeth, restore broken teeth, and attach dental bridges. Our crowns are carefully crafted to match your natural teeth in terms of color, shape, and size.

For those missing one or more teeth, dental bridges can be installed to fill the open space in your smile. This keeps your remaining teeth from shifting out of position and supports the proper alignment of your bite. For more comprehensive tooth replacement solutions, our doctors also offer dental implants to restore function and aesthetics.

## Emergency Dental Care When You Need It Most

Dental emergencies can happen at any time of day or night, and when they do, you need immediate attention from a knowledgeable team. Our dental office prioritizes emergency appointments because we understand that dental pain can be debilitating and affect every aspect of your life.

Common dental emergencies include:

- Severe toothaches
- Knocked-out teeth
- Broken or chipped teeth
- Lost fillings or crowns
- Dental abscesses

If you have a [knocked-out tooth](https://www.mouthhealthy.org/all-topics-a-z/dental-emergencies), the ADA recommends keeping it moist and attempting to reinsert it into the socket without touching the root. If that’s not possible, place it between your cheek and gums, and contact us immediately.

## Saving Your Natural Teeth With Root Canal Therapy

When tooth decay spreads to the inner pulp of your tooth, a root canal is likely needed to repair and save your tooth instead of extracting it. Despite common myths, modern root canal therapy is often associated with the same level of discomfort as placing a large filling.

During root canal treatment, we carefully remove the infected inner pulp, clean and disinfect the inside of the tooth, and seal it to hinder further infection. Most teeth that receive root canal treatment can be saved and function normally for years with proper care.

## When Is Extraction Necessary?

Sometimes, tooth extraction becomes essential to protect your overall oral health. Common reasons for extractions include severe decay, advanced periodontal disease, or overcrowding. When saving your tooth is no longer an option, our skilled team performs extractions with minimal discomfort and provides detailed aftercare instructions to promote proper healing and recovery.

Wisdom teeth removal is another standard extraction process. Unfortunately, many people don’t have enough space in their mouths for these third molars, leading to problems like impaction, crowding, or difficulty cleaning. Removing problematic wisdom teeth can prevent future complications. After extraction, patients may consider dental implants as a permanent replacement option.

## Making Dental Care Accessible

At Dental Group of Chicago, we understand that busy schedules can make it frustrating to prioritize dental care. That’s why we offer extended hours and work with most major dental insurance plans to make quality dental care accessible. Our team is always happy to help you maximize your insurance benefits and explore alternative financing options when needed.

We also offer a dental membership plan for patients without insurance, making preventive care and treatments more affordable. This plan includes regular cleaning, exams, and discounts on additional services to accommodate various budgets and ensure stress free access to care.

## Inlays and Onlays

Inlays and onlays can be made of porcelain, gold, or composite resin. These pieces are bonded to the damaged area of the tooth. An inlay, which is similar to a filling, is used inside the cusp tips of the tooth. An onlay is a more substantial reconstruction, similar to the inlay but extending out over one or more of the cusps of the tooth.

Dental inlays and onlays typically require two appointments to complete the procedure. During the first visit, the filling is replaced or the damaged or decaying area of the tooth is removed, and the tooth is prepared for the inlay or onlay. To ensure proper fit and bite, an impression of the tooth is made by the dentist, and sent to a lab for fabrication. The dentist will then apply a temporary sealant on the tooth and schedule the next appointment.

Traditional fillings can reduce the strength of a natural tooth by up to 50 percent. As an alternative, inlays and onlays, which are bonded directly onto the tooth using special high-strength resins, can actually increase the strength of a tooth by up to 75 percent. As a result, they can last from 10 to 30 years. In some cases, where the damage to the tooth is not extensive enough to merit an entire crown, onlays can provide a very good alternative.

# Cosmetic Dentistry South Loop, Chicago, IL

- [Cosmetic Dentistry](#cosmetic-dentistry)

## Cosmetic Dentistry

The South Loop has become one of Chicago’s most vibrant neighborhoods, and residents here deserve aesthetic dental care that matches their dynamic lifestyle. If you’re looking to enhance your smile while maintaining your busy schedule, cosmetic dentistry is a fantastic solution that can boost your confidence and improve your overall quality of life.

At Dental Group of Chicago, we understand that your time is valuable. That’s why we’ve designed our cosmetic dental care services with your convenience in mind. Our South Loop location offers extended hours from 8 AM to 8 PM weekdays, and Saturday appointments, making it easier for working professionals and busy families to prioritize their dental health without disrupting their daily routines.

## What is Cosmetic Dentistry?

Cosmetic dentistry includes any dental procedure designed to boost the look of your teeth, gums, and overall smile. Unlike general dentistry, which focuses primarily on oral health and function, cosmetic dentistry combines artistry with dental science to create beautiful, natural-looking results that enhance your facial features.

Modern cosmetic dentistry has evolved considerably over the past decade. Today’s procedures utilize high-tech materials and techniques that not only look better but also last longer than ever before. From subtle changes that address minor imperfections to complete smile makeovers, cosmetic dental treatments can address virtually any aesthetic concern you may have about your teeth.

## Popular Cosmetic Dentistry Procedures

Our practice offers a complete portfolio of cosmetic dental treatments, each designed to target specific aesthetic concerns while maintaining the highest standards of overall dental health.

### Teeth Whitening

Professional teeth whitening is the most sought-after cosmetic dental procedure on the market, and for good reason. Over time, our teeth naturally become stained from wine, tea, coffee, and other foods and beverages we consume daily. According to the [American Dental Association](https://www.mouthhealthy.org/all-topics-a-z/teeth-whitening), one of the leading causes of tooth staining is the pigments in food and drinks called chromogens that bind to the white, outer part of your teeth. Professional whitening treatments can drastically brighten your smile, often by multiple shades, in just one visit.

In-office whitening typically takes about an hour and provides immediate results. For those who prefer the convenience of at-home treatment, custom whitening trays offer a gradual but equally effective alternative. These trays are made specifically for your teeth, resulting in even coverage and optimal results.

### Porcelain Veneers

Dental veneers, are thin casings that cover the front surface of your teeth. They’re an excellent solution for teeth that are stained, chipped, slightly misaligned, or have gaps between them. Veneers can transform your smile by creating uniformly shaped, sized, and colored teeth.

The process typically requires two visits. During the first appointment, a small level of enamel is removed from the tooth surface to make space for the veneer. Temporary veneers can be placed while your permanent ones are being crafted in a dental laboratory. At the second appointment, the permanent veneers are secured to your teeth, resulting in a natural-looking, durable enhancement.

### Dental Crowns

Dental crowns serve both functional and cosmetic roles. When a tooth is significantly damaged or has undergone extensive dental work, a crown can restore its strength while improving its appearance. Modern crowns are milled from materials such as porcelain or ceramic that closely mimic the color and translucency of your real teeth.

Crowns can address various cosmetic concerns, including severely discolored teeth, misshapen teeth, or teeth with large fillings that compromise their appearance. This procedure requires two visits, allowing time for the crown to be custom-made to match your existing teeth perfectly.

### Dental Implants

For anyone with missing teeth, [dental implants](/dental-implants/) offer the most realistic and functional replacement option. An implant is made of a titanium post that’s surgically secured into the jawbone, topped with a crown that resembles your surrounding teeth. This produces an artificial tooth that looks, feels, and acts just like a normal tooth.

Beyond their cosmetic benefits, dental implants help retain facial structure and prevent bone deterioration that can occur when teeth are missing. They’re designed to last a lifetime, making them a high-quality, long-term investment in your smile and oral health.

### Invisalign Clear Aligners

Invisalign has revolutionized orthodontic treatment by offering an invisible way to correct tooth misalignment. These custom-made, clear plastic trays strategically move your teeth into their ideal positions without the appearance of conventional metal braces.

The [Invisalign treatment process](/invisalign/) begins with a digital scan of your teeth, which is used to create a series of aligner trays that you’ll wear for about 22 hours per day. Each tray is worn for approximately two weeks before progressing to the next one in the series. Most patients finish their treatment within 12 to 18 months, but this timeframe can vary for more complex cases or those with poor adherence to wearing instructions.

## The Cosmetic Dentistry Process

Understanding what to expect during your cosmetic dentistry treatment helps ensure you feel comfortable and confident throughout the process.

### Initial Consultation

Every procedure begins with a consultation, during which we’ll discuss your goals, concerns, budget, and expectations. During your first visit, we’ll examine your teeth, gums, and overall oral health to determine which procedures would be most beneficial for you. This is also an opportunity for you to ask questions and learn about the various treatment options available.

During this consultation, we may utilize digital imaging technology to display potential results and help you visualize the outcomes of different treatments. This approach ensures that you’re fully informed and comfortable with your treatment plan before we begin.

### Treatment Planning

During the next phase of treatment, we’ll develop a personalized treatment plan that addresses what is discussed during your consultation. This plan outlines the recommended procedures, timeline, and associated costs. We believe in complete transparency, so you’ll have a clear understanding of what to expect throughout your treatment.

For patients requiring multiple procedures, we’ll prioritize treatments to ensure optimal results while minimizing the number of appointments needed. Our comprehensive approach ensures we consider both aesthetics and function to support your overall health. Our goal is to make the process as convenient and comfortable as possible while helping you achieve the smile you’ve always wanted.

### Ongoing Care and Maintenance

After your cosmetic dental treatment is complete, maintaining your new smile is essential. We’ll provide you with specific care instructions and may recommend certain products to help preserve your results. Regular cleanings are necessary for maintaining both the appearance and health of your teeth.

Most cosmetic dental treatment options are durable and long-lasting, but they do require proper care to maintain their appearance. With good oral hygiene and regular dental visits, your investment in cosmetic dentistry can provide years of beautiful smiles.

## Our Commitment to Patient Care

We treat patients of all ages with compassion and respect, ensuring every visit to our office is comfortable and stress-free.

## Financing Your Cosmetic Dentistry

We recognize that cosmetic dentistry can be a substantial investment in your confidence and quality of life. That’s why we offer various financing options to make treatment more accessible. We accept most major insurance benefits, and while most cosmetic procedures are not covered, some treatments that improve function as well as appearance may have partial coverage.

For patients without insurance or those seeking additional payment options, we offer flexible financing through Cherry and other providers. These plans often feature low monthly payments and competitive interest rates, making it easier to get the smile you’ve always dreamed of without compromising your budget.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long do cosmetic dental treatments typically last?

The longevity of cosmetic dental treatments varies by procedure. Dental veneers and crowns can last 10-15 years with proper care, while dental implants are designed to last a lifetime. Invisalign results are permanent once treatment is complete and you wear your retainer as directed. Teeth whitening results typically last 1-3 years, depending on your diet and oral hygiene habits. Composite bonding may need touch-ups every 5-7 years. Our dentist will provide specific maintenance guidelines during your consultation to help you maximize the lifespan of your treatment.

### Are cosmetic dentistry procedures painful?

Most cosmetic dental procedures involve minimal discomfort. Our office uses local anesthesia for treatments that require tooth preparation, such as veneers or crowns, ensuring you remain comfortable throughout. Many procedures like teeth whitening and composite bonding require little to no anesthesia. Our gentle, patient-focused approach means we prioritize your comfort at every stage. If you experience dental anxiety, let our doctor know during your first visit so we can discuss sedation options to make your experience as relaxed as possible.

### Can cosmetic dentistry improve my oral health as well as appearance?

Absolutely. Many cosmetic dental treatments offer both aesthetic and functional benefits. For example, dental crowns restore damaged teeth while preventing further decay, and Invisalign straightens crooked teeth to improve bite function and make cleaning easier, supporting your overall dental health. Dental implants prevent bone loss and maintain jaw structure. Our comprehensive approach ensures we consider how each treatment will impact not just your smile’s appearance, but also your overall health and well-being. During your consultation, our cosmetic dentist will explain how your chosen procedures can benefit both form and function.

### What’s the difference between a general dentist and a cosmetic dentist?

While all dentists receive training in basic cosmetic procedures, a cosmetic dentist specializes in aesthetic treatments and has advanced training in procedures designed specifically to improve the appearance of your smile. Our team at Dental Group of Chicago focuses on creating beautiful smiles through specialized techniques in veneers, whitening, smile makeovers, and other aesthetic enhancements. We combine artistic vision with dental expertise to create natural-looking results that enhance your facial features while maintaining optimal oral health.

### Will I need to miss work or suffer through a long recovery period?

Most cosmetic procedures require minimal downtime. Teeth whitening, composite bonding, and initial Invisalign fittings can be completed in a single appointment with no recovery time needed. Even more involved procedures like veneers or crowns typically cause only mild sensitivity that resolves within a few days. Dental implant placement may require a few days of rest, though most patients return to normal activities quickly. Our dental team will provide detailed aftercare instructions and is always available to address any concerns. Many patients schedule treatments during their lunch break or after work, returning to their regular routine immediately. You won’t suffer through lengthy recovery periods, and the long-term benefits to your life and confidence make any minimal inconvenience worthwhile.

## Periodontal Disease Treatment

Periodontal disease silently affects nearly half of all American adults over 30, often progressing without obvious symptoms until significant damage has occurred. The condition begins as inflamed gums but can advance to destroy the bone and tissue supporting your teeth, ultimately leading to tooth loss if left untreated. Understanding your treatment options and seeking timely care can make the difference between preserving your natural smile and facing extensive dental restoration.

[Periodontal care](/periodontal-care/gum-disease-treatment) encompasses various treatments designed to stop disease progression, restore gum health, and help you maintain your natural teeth. At Dental Group of Chicago, we provide comprehensive periodontal disease treatment with flexible hours to accommodate busy schedules, making quality care accessible when you need it most.

## Understanding Periodontal Disease

Periodontal disease develops when bacterial plaque accumulates along and beneath the gum line, triggering an inflammatory response. Gingivitis represents the first stage, caused by plaque buildup along the gum line. In this initial stage, your gums become inflamed, appear red and swollen, and may bleed during brushing or flossing. While gingivitis can often be reversed with improved oral hygiene and professional cleanings, untreated cases progress to periodontitis.

As periodontitis develops, inflammation extends deeper into the supporting structures of your teeth. Gums pull away from tooth surfaces, forming pockets where bacteria accumulate and multiply. These infected pockets trigger your body’s immune response, which, combined with bacterial toxins, begins breaking down the bone and connective tissue holding your teeth in place. [Chronic periodontitis affects 47.2% of adults over 30](https://www.mouthhealthy.org/all-topics-a-z/gum-disease) in the United States and can lead to the loss of tissue and bone supporting your teeth. This destruction occurs progressively, and advanced cases result in loose teeth or tooth loss.

## Treatment Options for Periodontal Disease

Treatment approaches vary based on disease severity, your overall health, and how well you’ve responded to earlier treatments. Our team evaluates each case thoroughly to determine the most appropriate interventions for your situation.

This deep cleaning procedure serves as the foundation of periodontal disease treatment for most patients. Scaling removes plaque and tartar from tooth roots, while root planing smooths the root surfaces so gum tissue can reattach. The procedure involves cleaning below the gum line to remove bacterial deposits and hardened tartar from tooth roots.

During scaling, we use instruments to carefully remove plaque and tartar from both above and below the gum line. Root planing then smooths the root surfaces, removing bacterial toxins and creating a clean surface where gum tissue can reattach to your teeth. This smoothing also makes it more difficult for bacteria to recolonize the area. Most patients receive local anesthesia during this treatment to ensure comfort throughout the procedure.

Depending on the extent of your periodontal disease, we may treat one section of your mouth per appointment or address all affected areas in fewer, longer sessions. Following treatment, you may experience some sensitivity and mild discomfort for a few days, but these symptoms typically resolve quickly as your gums begin healing.

### Antibiotic Therapy

Some cases benefit from antibiotic therapy used alongside mechanical cleaning treatments. We may recommend local antibiotics placed directly into periodontal pockets after scaling and root planing. These controlled-release medications slowly dissolve over several days, delivering concentrated antibacterial effects right where infection exists.

Systemic antibiotics in pill or capsule form may be prescribed for more widespread or aggressive infections. These medications work throughout your body to help control bacterial infection and support the healing process, particularly when combined with professional cleaning procedures.

### Surgical Treatments

When non-surgical approaches don’t sufficiently reduce pocket depths or stop disease progression, surgical interventions may become necessary to preserve your teeth. Several surgical options address different aspects of periodontal disease and its effects on your oral structures.

Flap surgery involves lifting back the gums to provide direct access to tooth roots and underlying bone. After thoroughly cleaning the roots and removing diseased tissue, we reposition the gum tissue to fit snugly around your teeth, reducing pocket depth and making it easier for you to keep the area clean through daily home care.

Bone grafting procedures help rebuild bone destroyed by periodontitis. We place grafting material in areas of bone loss to encourage natural bone regeneration, providing stronger support for your teeth. Similarly, soft tissue grafting addresses gum recession by taking tissue from your palate or another source and attaching it to areas where gums have pulled away from teeth.

## Long-Term Maintenance and Prevention

Successfully treating periodontal disease requires ongoing commitment to oral health beyond the initial treatment phase. Most patients require periodontal maintenance cleanings every three to four months following active treatment, as these more frequent visits help prevent disease recurrence and catch any problems early. Your daily care routine remains essential to long-term success. Consider these key practices for maintaining healthy gums after treatment:

- Brush twice daily with a soft-bristle toothbrush using proper technique
- Floss once daily to remove plaque from between teeth and below the gum line
- Use an antimicrobial mouthrinse formulated to reduce bacteria associated with gum disease
- Avoid tobacco products, as smoking significantly increases recurrence risk
- Manage systemic health conditions, particularly diabetes, through proper medical care
- Maintain a balanced diet rich in nutrients to support immune function and tissue health

These practices work together to keep your gums healthy and prevent the return of periodontal disease.

Lifestyle modifications provide important support for gum health. If you smoke, quitting significantly improves treatment outcomes and reduces your risk of disease recurrence. Managing systemic conditions, particularly diabetes, helps keep periodontal disease under control. Stress reduction techniques and maintaining proper nutrition support immune function and tissue health, contributing to better periodontal outcomes. Our team can provide guidance on [general dentistry](/general-dentistry/) practices to maintain your oral health between periodontal maintenance visits.

## Osseous Surgery

Osseous surgery, sometimes referred to as pocket reduction surgery or gingivectomy, refers to a number of different surgeries aimed at gaining access to the tooth roots to remove tartar and disease-causing bacteria.

Osseous surgery is used to reshape deformities and remove pockets in the alveolar bone surrounding the teeth. It is a common necessity in effective treatment of more advanced periodontal diseases. The ultimate goal of osseous surgery is to reduce or eliminate the periodontal pockets that cause periodontal disease. Despite the word “surgery” the procedure is reported to feel more like a thorough cleaning. The specific goals of surgery include:

Reducing Bacterial Spread: Bacteria from the mouth can spread throughout the body and cause other life-threatening conditions such as heart disease and respiratory disease. Removing deep tartar and thereby bacteria can help reduce the risk of bacteria spreading.

Preventing Bone Loss: The immune system’s inflammatory response prompted by periodontal bacteria can lead to bone loss in the jaw region, and cause teeth to fall out. Osseous surgery seeks to stop periodontal disease before it progresses to this level.

Enhancing the Smile: Mouths plagued with periodontal disease are often unsightly. Brown gums, rotting teeth, and ridge indentations can leave a person feeling depressed and too self-conscious to smile. Fortunately, osseous surgery can help reduce bacteria and disease and thereby restore your mouth to its former radiance, while restoring confidence at the same time.

Facilitating Home Care: As the gum pocket deepens, it can become nearly impossible to brush and floss adequately. Osseous surgery reduces pocket size, making it easier to brush and floss, and thereby prevent further periodontal disease.

## Gingivectomy

The gum tissue can be very thick and large covering the tooth surface making the teeth look short. This can happen because of medications, bone that extends too close to the surface of the teeth, or inflammation due to gum disease.

A gingivectomy is a periodontal procedure that eliminates excess gum tissue. The term “gingivectomy” is derived from Latin:

- “gingiva” means gum tissue,
- “-ectomy” means to remove.

The following are some reasons a gingivectomy might be needed:

Cosmetics: To make the teeth look normal in size when the gum is covering too much of it, making the teeth look longer and more proportional.

Functional/Esthetics: To remove excess gum tissue (gingival overgrowth) that has formed as a result of certain drugs such as anti-seizure and organ-transplant medications, and certain high blood pressure medications.

Bone and gum health around the teeth: To shrink deep gum pockets. This procedure might require some bone work as well.

## Frenectomy

A frenum is a naturally occurring muscle attachment, normally seen between the front teeth (either upper or lower). It connects the inner aspect of the lip with the gum. A lack of attached gingiva, in conjunction with a high (closer to the biting surface) frenum attachment, which exaggerates the pull on the gum margin, can result in recession. Additionally, an excessively large frenum can prevent the teeth from coming together resulting in a gap between the front teeth. If pulling is seen or the frenum is too large to allow the teeth to come together, the frenum is surgically released from the gum with a frenectomy. A frenectomy surgery is simply the surgical removal of a frenum.

When orthodontic treatment is planned or initiated, the removal of an abnormal frenum, with or without a gingival graft, can increase stability and improve success of the final orthodontic result.

## Gum Graft

When recession of the gingiva occurs, the body loses a natural defense against both bacterial penetration and trauma. When gum recession is a problem, gum reconstruction using grafting techniques is an option.

When there is only minor recession, some healthy gingiva often remains and protects the tooth, so that no treatment other than modifying home care practices is necessary. However, when recession reaches the mucosa, the first line of defense against bacterial penetration is lost.

In addition, gum recession often results in root sensitivity to hot and cold foods as well as an unsightly appearance of the gum and tooth. When significant, gum recession can predispose to worsening recession and expose the root surface, which is softer than enamel, leading to root caries and root gouging.

A gum graft is designed to solve these problems. A thin piece of tissue is taken from the roof of the mouth or gently moved over from adjacent areas to provide a stable band of attached gingiva around the tooth. The gingival graft may be placed in such a way as to cover the exposed portion of the root.

The gum graft surgery procedure is highly predictable and results in a stable, healthy band of attached tissue around the tooth.

## Guided Bone & Tissue Regeneration

Gum disease has traditionally been treated by eliminating the gum pockets by trimming away the infected gum tissue and by re-contouring the uneven bone tissue. Although this is still an effective way of treating gum disease, new and more sophisticated procedures are used routinely today. One of these advancements is guided bone regeneration, also referred to as guided tissue regeneration. This procedure is used to stabilize endangered teeth or to prepare the jaw for dental implants.

As periodontal disease progresses, pockets of degenerated bone develop in the jaw. These pockets can promote the growth of bacteria and the spread of infection. To address these pockets, your doctor may recommend tissue regeneration. During this surgical procedure, the pockets are cleaned thoroughly, and a membrane is installed between the soft tissue and the pocket in the bone. Some of these membranes are bio-absorbable and some require removal. The membrane covers the pocket so that fast-growing soft tissue is blocked, and slower-growing bone can begin to grow, or “regenerate” itself.

The effectiveness of the procedure generally depends on the patient’s willingness to follow a strict post-operative diet and careful oral care. Your doctor will help you determine if bone regeneration surgery is right for you.

## Cosmetic Periodontal Surgery

Cosmetic periodontal procedures are a conventional way to cover unsightly, sensitive, or exposed root surfaces and to prevent future gum recession. If you are unhappy with the appearance of short, unsightly teeth, this can be greatly improved by a combination of periodontal procedures and cosmetic dentistry by your dentist.

Although your teeth appear short, they may actually be the proper length. The teeth may be covered with too much gum tissue. We can correct this by performing the periodontal plastic surgery procedure, crown lengthening. During this cosmetic gum surgery, excess gum and bone tissue are reshaped to expose more of the natural tooth. This can be done to more than one tooth, to even your gum line, and to create a beautiful smile.

Another cosmetic procedure is the soft tissue graft. It is used to cover unattractive tooth roots, reduce gum recession, and protect the roots from decay and eventual loss.

Tooth loss causes the jaw bone to recede and can lead to an unnatural looking indentation in your gums and jaw, and appearance of general aging. The original look of your mouth may not be recaptured because of spaces remaining under and between replacement teeth. They may appear too long compared to nearby teeth.

Bone grafting following tooth loss can preserve the socket/ridge and minimize gum and bone collapse. There is less shrinkage and a more aesthetic tooth replacement for either an implant crown or fixed bridge around the replacement teeth.

## Oral Cancer Screening

The oral cancer test is completely painless. Your doctor will look for abnormalities and feel the face, glands, and neck for unusual bumps. Lasers may be used to highlight pathologic changes, and can “look” below the surface for spots and lesions invisible to the naked eye. Some of the signs that will be investigated are red patches and sores. Red patches on the floor of the mouth, or the front of the tongue, and bleeding sores which fail to heal easier, can be indicative of cancerous changes. Leukoplakia is a hardened white or gray, slightly raised lesion that can appear inside the mouth, and may be cancerous. Signs of these will be examined as well. Finally, soreness, lumps or the general thickening of tissue anywhere in the throat or mouth can signal pathologic signs, and will be examined.

If abnormalities, lesions, lumps, or leukoplakia are apparent, your doctor will implement a treatment plan that is right for you. Treatment options vary according to the precise diagnosis, but may include: excision, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

It is also important to note that over 75% of oral cancers are linked with avoidable behaviors such as smoking, tobacco use, and excessive alcohol consumption. We can provide you with literature and options about quitting dangerous behaviors such as tobacco use. Oral cancer screenings are important to allow for early treatment, if needed.

If you’re experiencing tooth pain after hours, you’re likely wondering whether to seek immediate care or wait until morning. Understanding when dental pain requires urgent attention can help you avoid unnecessary discomfort and make informed decisions about your oral health.
At Dental Group of Chicago, we understand that dental emergencies don’t follow a 9-to-5 schedule. That’s why we’re here to help guide you through these situations and provide the after-hours care you need. We know how stressful dental pain can be, especially when it happens outside regular business hours, and we want to ensure you get the relief you deserve.Sep 10, 2025Learn more
