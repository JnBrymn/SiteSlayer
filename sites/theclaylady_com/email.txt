SUBJECT: A new way to guide aspiring (and curious) artists on The Clay Lady’s Campus

-----------------------------------------

Hi Danielle,

I’ve enjoyed exploring how The Clay Lady’s Campus brings together artists, students, and enthusiasts through workshops, classes, and gallery events. It’s clear you’ve created something special where creativity thrives!

I wanted to share a quick idea. At SlayDigital.ai, we help community spaces like yours make their websites feel even more welcoming by adding a simple AI chat agent that can answer common questions—using the information already on your site.

To show you what this looks like, I made a custom demo of your website:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/theclaylady_com  
You’ll see a chat icon in the lower-right corner. Just click to open the box and type a question—the agent will reply using your content.

You can try asking things like:
- “When does class registration open, and how does the waitlist work?”
- “What is included in the Clay At Home Kits?”
- “How can I schedule a field trip or private tour?”
- “What supplies do I need for a pottery class, and where can I buy them?”
- “When is the next campus-wide holiday sale?”

This helps visitors get quick answers, frees up staff time, and makes your community’s resources even easier to discover—without changing your website’s spirit or warmth.

Would you like to see how this could work for your team or artists? Happy to chat or set up a quick call, no pressure.

Take what you think and feel—mix it all up, and let me know what you think!

Warm regards,  
Zac
