SUBJECT: A Simple Way to Help Visitors Find Their Place at The Clay Lady’s Campus

Hi Danielle and team,

I love how The Clay Lady’s Campus brings Nashville’s clay community together—whether someone is looking for classes, workshops, supplies, or just inspiration.

I’m Zac Slay, founder of SlayDigital.ai. We build simple, custom AI chat agents that turn your website’s content into a friendly guide for visitors—helping answer questions quickly, so you can spend more time nurturing creativity and less time on repetitive emails.

To show what this could look like for your site, we’ve created a short demo:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/theclaylady_com  
Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner and type your question—answers come straight from information already on your site.

You can try asking things like:
- When do class registrations open and how does the waitlist work?
- What workshops are available for beginners or families?
- How do I book a field trip for my school group?
- What are Mid-South Ceramics store hours?
- How can I see or purchase work from your resident artists?

If making your website even more helpful for newcomers and regulars sounds worthwhile, I’d be happy to chat further or let you test the agent on your own.

Wishing you and your artists a great week,  
Zac Slay
