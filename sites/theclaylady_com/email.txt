SUBJECT: See How an Onsite Chat Agent Can Support Your Clay Community

-----------------------------------------

Hi Danielle,

I’m continually inspired by how The Clay Lady’s Campus makes clay art truly accessible and welcoming in Nashville. You have so many engaged visitors with different goals—whether they’re looking for classes, workshops, supplies, or just to experience the creative community in person.

I wanted to share a simple way we can help your team save time while making your site even more helpful for future visitors. At SlayDigital.ai, we build clear, friendly AI chat agents that embed directly on your website and answer questions using all the information you already provide for your community.

I made a quick demo using your site: [https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/theclaylady_com](https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/theclaylady_com). Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner to ask questions—no setup needed. The agent uses your current answers and policies, not generic AI advice.

For example, you can try asking:
- How do I join a pottery or handbuilding class, and when do registrations open?
- Can I drop in to make pottery, or do I need to register for a workshop?
- What’s included in a Clay At Home Kit, and how do I pick up finished pieces?
- How can I book a private group workshop and what’s the minimum group size?
- Do you offer kiln repair or public firing for artists without a kiln?

If you’d like to explore how this could help your staff and students—or have ideas for improvement—I’d love to connect. No commitment, just happy to chat about making your clay experience even smoother.

Warm regards,  
Zac
