Teaching Clay - The Clay Lady’s Mission


# About The Clay Lady

Danielle McDaniel is The Clay Lady®

The Clay Lady is best known since 1982 for her clay teaching program in the schools of Middle Tennessee. She has dedicated her life to the transformative power of art by teaching clay to hundreds of thousands of children and ensuring clay would be taught in the classroom by educating art teachers The Clay Lady Way, a teaching modality for art teachers nationally.

She created The Clay Lady’s Campus, an art community in Nashville, Tennessee, which sees over 500 students and artists each week, filling studios and classrooms with enhancing, creative endeavors. For all ages, all levels and in all circumstances, Danielle~The Clay Lady has created a way for clay to be accessible to everyone via videos, books, seminars and The Campus.

[Danielle's Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danielle_McDaniel)

How it all began

Remembering a 1st place prize she’d won for a clay baby shoe she’d made with art teacher Sandra Kandros during a middle school 4-H arts and crafts contest, Danielle McDaniel took her first pottery class in 1981 through Nashville Metro Parks and Recreation. Soon after embracing clay’s lesson of “process, not project”, Danielle offered to help her Metro Parks Instructor Lena Lucas with kids’ classes and soon afterward was teaching those same classes. Ann Horan, Director of the Centennial Arts Center, saw Danielle’s enthusiasm and offered her a full-time teaching position at the Bellevue Community Center, where Danielle would go on to teach for 15 years. During that time, Danielle also worked at Mid-South Ceramic Supply Company (then owned by Tom Turnbull) which provided a full scope of ceramics information and education.

In 1982, at the request of one of her student’s parents, Danielle taught clay at a birthday party. The clay plates were decorated with slips and single-fired for efficiency and quick turn-around. Two elementary school teachers attended that party and asked Danielle if she would come to their classrooms to teach a clay workshop for an in-house field trip. This began Danielle’s career as “The Clay Lady”.

By 1995, Danielle was teaching 500 to 800 kids per week in schools throughout Middle Tennessee–full grade levels at a time in school cafeterias–and was booked two years in advance. The art teachers of these schools came to The Clay Lady’s workshops and asked Danielle to provide information about how she was teaching the quantity and quality of clay projects in a such short amount of time. Danielle started teaching The Clay Lady’s Inservices; sharing her projects, her Clay Paints , and the single-firing process. To further help these teachers, Danielle wrote How to Teach Clay…The Clay Lady Way in 1996. She also produced instructional videos and started teaching inservices on a national level.

In 2010, Danielle and business associate, Tami Archer, purchased Mid-South Ceramic Supply Company. This enabled Danielle to market The Clay Lady Way on a larger scale and to develop an educational program at the Mid-South Ceramic Supply Company’s facilities in Nashville. After acquiring three more buildings on the property, the business expanded exponentially.  Danielle established The Clay Lady’s Campus whose mission is to be a creative community nurturing creativity through life-giving community, one artist at a time.

Currently, Danielle oversees 75 on-premise artists with private studios, 700 pottery and sculpture students, and numerous workshops and community events each year on The Clay Lady’s Campus. Danielle is sought after to teach not only her inservices, but to also share her successful business model of the The Clay Lady’s Campus. Danielle provides keynotes about her experience, sharing what she loves to do every day with people of all ages, in all circumstances, and at all skill levels.

## “Take what you think. Take what you feel. Mix it all up, and make something real.”

Since 1982, this motto has been repeated by The Clay Lady and her students in every class and workshop. It encompasses her philosophy surrounding the greatness and goodness of being an artist; it goes beyond creating a clay project. It asks the artist to consider the call that artists not only make beautiful things, but they are called to make the world a more beautiful place.

### Our Pottery, Handbuilding, and Sculpture Instructors


During Class: We may go down a 30 minute rabbit hole on different history and how ceramics impacted culture. Did You Know: I can tie any fact back into pottery. Ask me how I can relate Northern Europeans thinking tomatoes were poisonous back to ceramics!As An Artist: I am an artist by being a teacher. My skillset is knowledge and explanations to make are through you. Instagram: @josephmcdanielceramics

Merideth Holder

During Class: You might see some Some flopping pots and dancing to the oldies. Did You Know: When I'm not in the studio you'll find me in the garden or on a hike with my family. As An Artist: I seek out beauty in the everyday. Observing and making are key to the way I exist in the world.Instagram: @merideth.holderWebsite: meridethholder.com


During Class: I might change your name entirely and my dog will do tricks.Did You Know: I was a cowgirl once, a dog trainer briefly, and a wedding dress salesgirl. As An Artist: I got my BFA in ceramics in 2013 but that is irrelevant. Spending dedicated time in a supportive community is what really fed my creative drives. I'm passionate about showing my students that same support. Instagram: @tidalsedgestudio

Catherine McMurray

During Class: I do have a hard time with names and sometimes men especially become “Bob”. Just to make it easy. Also we do listen to music and that usually comes from the 70’s, for some it is entirely new.:)Did You Know: I worked in the dental world before having a studio of my own. I have also have 3 daughters, a husband and 8 grandchildren. All local.
As An Artist: I received my BFA from Potsdam College of NY. Clay has been a lovely, rich part of my life all these years that I want to share. I have been teaching now for almost 10 years from beginners to advanced from pinch pots to Raku ware! What is always remarkable is that the students teach and feed me also. A circle of learning we all need to experience for the full reward of clay.
Instagram: @Cgmcmurray

Christine Roth

During Class: I don't take myself too seriously when it comes to clay so I encourage others to do the same. Expect to have fun and enjoy making mistakes and not being perfect!Did You Know: I love wearing overalls to work with clay so if I have to make a stop on the way home I don't look bonkers.
As An Artist: Clay is not a job, it's a joy. I do this work for peace of mind. I never let it become a job for me. I enjoy spending time with people talking about clay and asking about their work and sharing ideas. Instagram: @thesinginggecko

Rachel Moore

During Class: I’ll try out as many silly metaphors as it takes to make new concepts stick! There’s always more than one way to approach clay, and I’m excited to discover new ways to do things alongside my students.
Did You Know: In addition to pottery, I also love writing, sewing, and animals of all kinds - ask me about my pet gecko!
As An Artist: My favorite thing to hear as a potter is that a piece of my work is part of someone’s daily routine.
Instagram: @hayesroadstudio


During Class: You might see me surprise myself and start screaming out of excitement!Did You Know: I coach Crossfit and have been trained to screen injuries. As An Artist: I've been making pots for over 20 years and I'm just now creating work that looks like it came from the same artist. Instagram: @lxceramix

Alexis Colbert

During Class: Sometimes the more seasoned students gather round new students to give their stories in support and extra hand holding. We get through it with the community! And we learn we can let go and rebuild at any time.Did You Know: I also make puppets. About 10 years ago some of my puppets appeared in a nationally released movie called “Plush”. It was such a cool experience to sit in a movie theater with a bag of popcorn and see my puppets, 8 feet tall, on the screen. As An Artist: My work explores our animal nature and how that relates to the human longing for a metaphysical reality. While I have benefited from formal education, earning a Bachelor of Arts in Communication and a Masters Degree in Theology, I am the product of self and community learning as an artist. I have shown my work nationally in galleries, art shows, and won various awards (Merit Awards from Tennessee Craft and Oz events). Instagram: @whenbunniesfly


During Class: My pottery pups, Captain Jack and Poppins, will most likely inspect your pieces and ask for payment in the form of pets. You might even get a nose boop of approval on some pots (they're very gentle, though - only light boops).Did You Know: I taught general education for ten years in public, private, and international schools.As An Artist: In all areas of my life, I seek to learn and grow. So as an artist, I am constantly researching and testing out new methods so that I can understand as much as possible, and bring that information to others.
Instagram: @motopotterycoWebsite: www.motopottery.co/

Cheryl Benus

During Class: I’ve been molding young minds (and clay) for 24 years as an art teacher in North Jersey! I taught everything from K to 8, and adults so I know how to handle both hyperactive hands and ambitious projects.Did You Know: You’ll learn the basics of hand building—from slabs to coils to pinching—but beware, clay has a mind of its own! Come ready to get your hands dirty and to make mistakes that turn into masterpieces.As An Artist: I’ve been a hand builder for 40 years, making everything from bowls to sculptures. My studio’s on the first floor of the co-op, come visit!
Instagram: @thelefthandedsculptorWebsite: www.cheryleveclayworks.com

Olivia Mills

During Class: I'll keep you on your toes! We may all have a sing-along if a great song comes on, I may throw a riddle out there for everyone to solve, maybe hide a tiny pot in the studio for a scavenger hunt... You never know! It will be lots of fun!Did You Know: I have a slew of hobbies outside of pottery and love to learn new skills! My main hobbies include hunting, drawing, painting, backpacking, teaching mahjong, etc etc. And I take my dog everywhere I can with me!As An Artist: I've been throwing pots for 20 years and am still finding new styles to try out and new forms that excite me! That's the best part of clay. It's ever changing and new ideas are always there to be explored.
Instagram: @oliviaclairestudiosWebsite: www.oliviaclairestudios.com


During Class: In class we will have fun creating together, helping one another grow, and building community.
Did You Know: I love to travel and spend time outdoors. I may show you a photo of my furbaby, Ramona the cat.
As An Artist: I like to explore many different styles and techniques. I like to push myself out of my comfort zone. Sometimes I learn best by failing first. After all, "It's just mud."


During Class: I will try any new technique or skill - therefore I may fail in a big way that teaches that new technique or skill!Did You Know: I love to write and have tried for 40 years to merge my pottery and poetry!As An Artist: I try to be an artist in everything I do, every day, in every way!Instagram:@danielle.theclayladyWebsite: theclaylady.com


During Class: After taking 8 weeks to learn and hone our pottery skills, we always end the session with Clay Olympics on the 9th and final week! Both new and returning students are encouraged to practice and show off by participating in our games! Did You Know: I have a background in the biological sciences and 2D art.As An Artist: I have always had this fascination with creating things with my bare hands, and I think it is why I am far more interested in the process and journey of creating art than the final pieces themselves!

Leah Quazi

During Class: We’ll slow down, settle in, and learn new ways to express our creativity together!Did You Know: I love wordplay and puns and my sense of humor is dryer than your bisque ware.As An Artist: I’m a Texas native and made my first wheel thrown pot in 2005. I love throwing tall vases, tiny pots, and closed forms, and am drawn to using earthy matte glazes.Instagram: @leebeepottery

Susan Lawless

During Class: It’s possible I could break out into song and probably won’t get the words right.Did You Know: I love riding in my jeep with my dogs, Louie and Charlie.As An Artist: It’s very satisfying to take a mound of clay and shape it into a creature that takes on its own personality. Most of my pieces are Raku fired. I love the anticipation of how each piece will turn out with so many different variables. Instagram: @susanlawlessceramicsWebsite: susanlawlessceramics.com


During Class: You might see clay in my hair and on my glasses. I joyfully embrace the mess and encourage my students to do the same. I’m also a big fan of the sky, so be prepared to take a break at the wheel and watch the sunset with me.
Did You Know: When I’m not in my studio, I’m finding a trail to hike or a creek to dip my toes in. Sometimes I do that with my goofy bloodhound Gus.As An Artist: I love clay because there’s always something new to learn and explore. After 8 years of creating, I still don’t have “my style” figured out. And I find a lot of excitement in that. I do know I love to carve. No pot is safe from my “I could carve that” mentality.


During Class: It will be fun and challenging. I really encourage students to get out of their own head and just have fun with clay. Everything is fixable!
Did You Know: I have 5 dogs, I can't help myself.
As An Artist: I like to just experiment and explore until I find a style or technique I'm happy with. Once I've practiced that, start experimenting again!
Instagram: @happyhappypots

Hank Sekeres

During Class: We will have fun while I encourage you to let go of your expectations and focus on creativity.
Did You Know: I'm the tallest person on staff and I've climbed the tallest mountain in Ireland.
As An Artist: I try to look at where we've come from in ceramics and honor that in my work.

### Our History

Danielle~The Clay Lady and Tami Archer purchased Mid-South Ceramic Supply Company in 2007. By 2010, the Pottery Studio expanded, growing from 25 students to 150 students. Due to the increase in these students’ skill level, Danielle wanted to offer them an even better opportunity for creative growth. These artists needed more than just a class but weren’t ready or able to setup an in-home studio. At this juncture, the building next door to Mid-South Ceramic Supply became available, and thus The Clay Lady’s Resident Artist Community began.

The entire building was made ready by a core group of eight artists (all were students from the studio) and by Habitat for Humanity ReStore! The artists came in every day for five weeks to paint, scrape, scrub, demolish and build what was needed to create a home for artists’ private studios and galleries where they could sell their work. Currently, this program has expanded into other buildings for even more opportunities for artists.

## The Clay Lady Way®

In 1982, Danielle taught her first clay class not knowing how that single step would begin her journey as The Clay Lady®. Her love of clay turned into a national enterprise as over the years, her teaching style developed into a modality that has transformed art curriculum in thousands of schools and studios across the country.

The Clay Lady Way was developed during her 30 years teaching on-site to groups of 50 -100 artists at one time, bringing the opportunity to design successful class management and to curate a system of entertaining projects completed in one sitting with only a single firing. Sharing this information to art teachers across the country via books, inservices, and videos has become the joy of Danielle~The Clay Lady’s career.

Mid-South Ceramics History

Mid-South Ceramic Supply Company was established in 1986 by Tom Turnbull. He set up his shop in a 2,000 square foot warehouse on the north side of Nashville. Tom was quickly able to establish himself and Mid-South Ceramics within the local art community and schools as the place for friendly, reliable and quality products; something that is the backbone of our business today.

In 1988, a local university asked Tom if he could develop a line of commercial glazes for their use… and Opulence Glaze was born. Working with a ceramic engineer to develop a top quality dipping glaze, Opulence Glaze started production in 1989 with 12 glazes. Today, we have over 70 glazes.

[LEARN MORE ABOUT OPULENCE GLAZE](https://theclaylady.com/opulence-glaze/)

Tom always had a longing to get back to his roots as a potter, so in 1999 he sold Mid-South Ceramics to Esmalglass, a Spanish frit and stain manufacturer. Mid-South Ceramics moved in 2003 to a building just east of downtown Nashville with 13,000 square feet. This gave the company the opportunity to offer more products and increase its inventory. It also gave the company the space to build a teaching studio for the community.

Danielle McDaniel was hired in 2005 to teach the evening pottery classes and they were a success. In 2007, Danielle and long time employee, Tami Archer, purchased Mid-South Ceramics. Danielle had established herself as The Clay Lady with 20 years of teaching clay in the schools throughout Middle Tennessee and Tami had 20 years of experience working under Tom at Mid-South Ceramics.Since 2007, Mid-South Ceramics has continued to grow and become a leading supplier of quality products in the United States. We continue to manufacture Opulence Glaze with five distinct lines of over 70 glazes and The Clay Lady’s line of products. Danielle and Tami have acquired more space, including The Clay Lady’s Studio, Studio B and The Clay Lady’s Artist Co-op and Gallery, all located on The Clay Lady’s Campus. We are more than a ceramic shop or studio, but a creative community that seeks to nurture creativity through life-giving community, one artist at a time.

On Being An Artist < The Clay Lady Studios


# On Being An Artist

The Clay Lady’s Definition of Being an Artist…

Take what you think, take what you feel, mix it all up, and make something real!

Since 1982 I have taught students my simple rhyme that illustrates everyone can be an artist. Although simple, I have found it holds great meaning and power. When I first began teaching my definition of being an artist, it was a straightforward formula for taking something ordinary, adding an artist’s best thoughts and feelings to this ordinary thing to make it the best it could be—an easy definition of what an artist does. As I progressed in my artistic life, I could see the power in this rhyme as I used it not just for clay, but for everything. I began to understand the power in making my thoughts and feelings real to create my business, my relationships, and my life. It was later in my journey as an artist that I uncovered the deeper meaning hidden in each word.

Take

It is an important word. As a unique individual in the history of humanity, you have distinctive gifts and talents. But just like at a birthday – you can be given a gift, but until you TAKE it, open it, play with it… it is not yours. You do not own your gifts until you TAKE them.

What you think

We all have thoughts. We all have perceptions. Thoughts are a vital part of the equation in being an artist. Thoughts bring that first wave of inspiration. But they are just the beginning of the journey.

You cannot just give birth to a business or idea or art. You must learn to parent that business or idea or art. Consider my own experience as a clay artist when I am throwing a pot. I focus my thoughts on what I am doing. However, I must practice, learn, and experience to expand that thinking and express myself in the best way possible.

It is important to expand your thoughts: learn, read, take classes, talk to mentors.

It is good to have thoughts, they are the seeds of creating, but you cannot stop there…

Take what you feel

This is where a lot of artists start. We want to be an artist so we can express ourselves…the joy! The angst! I meet new artists that have a vision of how it will feel in their studio. However, the creative energy can be overwhelmed as they indulge in their feelings. If not balanced with thoughtful thinking, it can become drama and a story for only one. We are called to create—not only to enhance ourselves—but the world.

Feelings flow easily in this equation for being an artist. However, if the feelings are insecurity, anxiety, or fear, then your unexplored feelings can block your creativity.

It is an artist’s responsibility to develop skills to learn how to understand and think about their feelings, especially negative feelings. There is creative strength in knowing you can control destructive feelings with constructive messages of determination, tenacity, and persistence. There is power in finding the core of your motivation to make art—power in knowing your thoughts and feelings are yours to express. It must be an artist’s quest to express in constructive ways that connect to the viewer, that show the way to overcome.

Let me clarify that I am not advocating for art that expresses only positivity. I am advocating for art that enhances, not diminishes. A painting of a mother in mourning, although expressing wrenching heartache, can also create connection and understanding to a viewer which enhances their own healing journey.

Artists are constructive, not destructive.Art enhances, not diminishes.

Mix it all up

As a pottery teacher, I have seen students find the logic of the potter’s wheel – the forces in play as the clay spins. They quickly make a vessel but may feel dissatisfied with the process. Other students strongly love the idea of pottery but may not be successful navigating the invisible forces impacting the clay. My job as a teacher is to balance a student’s thoughts of creating a pot on a wheel with the feelings of loving the act of creation. Thoughts and feelings mix to create a unique, individual expression. This expression changes with the balance, or imbalance, of the artist’s thoughts and feelings.

As an artist you must decide what IT is by releasing your own recipe of thoughts and feelings. The IT is the who that you are.

You must mix it ALL. The good with the bad – the thoughts of loss with the thoughts of gain. The feelings of loss as well as the feelings of gain.

And you must mix it UP. Upward. Up where the perspective is bigger, the purpose is higher.

and Make

As I sit at my potter’s wheel, it is empty; and after I begin, it is filled. What was a spark inside me is now in front of me. Even if I pull it down and start again, the clay is filled with memories, experience. The failed pot gives its life to teach me how to make the next pot better.

YOU make. Empty spaces are not made. Empty spaces are voids waiting to be filled by what you make. Infinite space is waiting to be filled by you.

Creativity is not just an idea, but the voice of the universe calling you to create.

Making is creating.

Something

Your something. Your spark creating a fire in the void. Your thoughts and feelings made into your expression with its own unique voice. Your gifts and talents manifest. You are the creator filling a space with more of you. Unique, individual you.

Real

Reality is sometimes defined as “It is what it is.” Or that which cannot be changed. Or the truth. We know there are many levels of perceptions. Let’s keep it simple and know that when you see your thoughts and feelings in front of your eyes, in whatever form, that’s real. Your art. Your gift. You, enhancing this world.

You can be an artist at anything by just adding the best of you to ordinary things. Clay is the most ordinary of any material on earth. Yet it holds within it magic and possibility. You hold the same magic inside you…

The good news is that if you are not satisfied with your reality, my definition also works as a prescription to help show the way.

I started The Clay Lady’s business in 1982. I did not go to college. I am self-taught. I have learned my way out of many spots with the right book or mentor. I have had my share of challenges, naysayers, and tears. However, when things were not going well, I always had my simple definition of being an artist:

Remember the word TAKE…I am in control of what I think and feel.

Remember the word THINK…I can always learn my way out of a bad situation.

Remember the word FEEL… I must follow my joy, not my fear.

Remember to MIX IT ALL UP…not just the bad or just the good, but lift up both.

MAKE IT REAL! What is in front of me is made with my thoughts and feelings. I can make it better.

# Reconditioning Clay

Reconditioning Clay – an excerpt from Danielle~The Clay Lady’s Lesson Book for Potters

When you get your clay directly from the clay supplier, your clay should be perfect. Is the right ratio of water and clay, it’s consistent, there are no air bubbles, and it is ready to use right out of the bag. After you work on the wheel you will have clay that has become too wet.  If you hand build you may have clay that is too dry. When you trim, you have leatherhard shavings. If you have a pot that’s bone dry and breaks, that clay is extremely dry.  You can put all of this clay together and reconstitute it back into perfect clay!

There are many ways of reconstituting clay. The most common (and labor intensive) is to put all of this clay into a bucket with water. After a few weeks and all the clay slakes to the bottom, you cast the water off pull the clay out.  Lay it on wood or plaster to absorb some of the water and let it stiffen.  Then you can wedge into usable clay.

There are also very expensive pieces of equipment, pug mills, that can take all of the clay in its different stages and mix. Some pug mills even de-air to ensure consistent clay.

In a home or community studio we can simplify this process of reconstituting clay.

-As you make and have scraps or collapse pots, the wet clay can be wadded up and put that in the top of your bag or clay container. When you trim, gather the clay trimmings out of your splash pan in your fisted hand. Then, holding the trimmings, put your entire hand into your bucket until you feel the water soak in and dampen the trimmings. Squeeze your fist and then put the wad of trimmings in the top of your bag or clay container. Within a couple days, or if you are taking a weekly class, the next week, cut and layer the wet clay and the trimming wadded clay like a stack of pancakes. Using a wire clay cutter, cut that into one-inch chunks. Restack and then wedge together.

-If your clay is still a little wet, you can sprinkle some dry ball clay (which is dry powdered clay that you can get from your clay supply store) and wedge into your clay. Similar to spreading flour on your cutting board to knead dough in if it is too sticky.

-If your clay is a little stiff, you can slice the piece into pancakes. Use a fork to cut little riverbeds across each pancake. Use a spray bottle to fill those riverbeds with water.  Restack the pancakes. Cut into one-inch chunks and then wedge again.

-If you have an amount of clay that is hard, cut into one inch squares, spray water into a bag and put the clay in the bag. Close the bag. Because you cut the clay into little cubes there’s more surface area for the water to soak in. In a few days you can pull out the clay, push it together and then wedge to work that water evenly through an create a consistent ball of clay.

-If you have broken pots that are bone dry you can break it up into pieces and put into a bag that has been sprayed with water. Close the bag up and the pieces will absorb the water where you can eventually wedge it into usable clay.

-If you are making a set of dishes, wedge more balls of clay than needed out of the same bag or batch of clay.  It is a must to have clay for each piece that is the same clay to water ratio as the others for everything to fire and shrink the same size. To illustrate, you are making a set of four plates and last one is a blunder. If you take the clay of the blundered plate and wedge it, (even weighing it to the same as the others) and throw again (even measuring to match the other 3) because the water to clay ratio is different, this plate will shrink at a different percentage than the first 3 after they are fired.

The water to clay ration determines the softness and malleability of your clay.  A little wet, it will center easily but fall apart quickly. A little stiff, it will be hard to center but it will pull up thinner.  Just right and you can have control at both steps.

The consistency of your clay creates a smooth transition as you shape.  If you have stiff clay and wet clay in the same ball, as you shape, each will react differently to your hand’s position and pressure. This will create a wobbly or unlevel wall.

If the condition of your clay is determined how well and how much you wedged your clay.  If there are air bubbles, dry specks of clay, contaminates or differing cone ratings of clay, throwing a quality pot will be a challenge.

The water to clay ratio, the consistency and the condition of your clay is not only important for success at the wheel, it also is doing yourself a favor. Throwing or handbuilding with too wet or too dry clay only sets you up for frustration. Think of clay as the most important tool you take to the wheel.   Take time to create a good quality ball of clay so that your work at the wheel can be successful.  Use your energy and mind space for craftmanship and form, not the quality of your clay.
