SUBJECT: A simple way to help your patients find answers faster on your website

-----------------------------------------
Hi Dr. Adamson,

I’ve been browsing Nolensville Family Dentistry’s site and really admire your focus on compassionate, high-quality care for every patient. Your commitment to making dental visits comfortable comes through in every detail.

I’m reaching out from SlayDigital.ai, where we build simple, custom AI web agents that help visitors get instant answers from your site content—without replacing your personal touch.

To give you a feel, I put together a quick demo based on your website:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/nolensvillefamilydentistry_com

If you click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner, a chat box will open. Visitors can type questions and get clear answers straight from your website, any time of day.

You can try asking things like:
- What should I bring to my first appointment?
- Do you accept Cigna or Metlife insurance?
- What cosmetic dental services do you offer?
- What are your office hours and location?
- How do I pay my bill online?

This kind of tool can help reduce repetitive calls, make information easier for patients to find, and ensure your warm, welcoming approach shines through digitally, too.

If you’d like to see how something like this could support your team, I’d love to hear your thoughts—no pressure at all.

Warm regards,  
Zac  
Founder, SlayDigital.ai
