SUBJECT: Helping Nolensville Families Get Answers Faster—See Your Site’s New Chat Agent

-----------------------------------------

Hi Dr. Adamson,

I love how Nolensville Family Dentistry puts compassion and comfort at the heart of every visit. Your welcoming approach really shines through for new and returning patients alike.

I wanted to share something simple that could make your website experience even more helpful for families in Nolensville: a custom AI web agent that answers visitor questions, right from your own site.

You can see a live demo tailored to your practice here: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/nolensvillefamilydentistry_com. Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner to open the chat box—then type any question, and the agent will reply using trusted info already on your site.

You can try asking things like:
- What should I bring to my first appointment?
- Which dental insurance plans do you accept?
- What services do you offer for children and families?
- How do I pay my bill online?
- What are your office hours and days of operation?

We design these agents to save your team time and make life easier for your patients—not add more tech complexity. If this looks helpful, I’d love to hear your feedback or answer any questions.

Warm regards,  
Zac Slay
