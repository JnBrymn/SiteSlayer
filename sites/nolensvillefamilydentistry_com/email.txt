SUBJECT: Helping New Patients Get Answers Instantly on Your Website

-----------------------------------------
Hi Dr. Adamson,

I love Nolensville Family Dentistry’s focus on compassion and making every visit comfortable for all ages—it really shines through your site.

I wanted to introduce myself—I'm Zac, founder of SlayDigital.ai. We help practices like yours provide even warmer, more informed online experiences by building simple, custom AI chat agents that use the information already on your website to answer visitor questions instantly.

I've put together a quick demo for you here: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/nolensvillefamilydentistry_com. There’s a chat icon in the bottom-right corner—click to open it, and visitors can type questions and get clear answers from your existing content.

You can try asking things like:
- “What insurance plans do you accept?”
- “What should I expect as a new patient?”
- “What dental services do you offer for kids?”
- “How do I pay my bill online?”
- “What are your office hours?”

Our goal is to help your team spend less time fielding repetitive questions, while helping patients feel informed and confident—before they even walk through your doors.

Let me know if you’d like to chat about making this permanent for your practice (or if you have any feedback on the demo). I’m here if you have questions!

Warm regards,  
Zac
