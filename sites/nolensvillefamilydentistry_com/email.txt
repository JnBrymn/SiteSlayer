Hi Dr. Adamson,

I’m impressed by the warmth and care you bring to Nolensville Family Dentistry, ensuring every patient feels comfortable—whether it’s their first visit or their hundredth.

I lead SlayDigital.ai, where we help dental practices like yours make website information easy to find for patients—without adding complexity for your team. Our custom AI web agent lets visitors chat with your site and quickly get answers using the content you already provide.

I put together a quick demo using your website:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/nolensvillefamilydentistry_com  
Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner to open the box, then type a question to see how it works.

You can try asking things like:
- What should I bring for my first appointment?
- Which dental insurance plans do you accept?
- What services do you offer for children?
- How do I schedule a visit or pay online?
- What are your office hours?

If making it even easier for patients to get answers sounds helpful, I’d be glad to chat further—no pressure at all.

Warm regards,  
Zac
