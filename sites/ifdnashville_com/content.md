Dr. Parkes | Iroquois Dentistry | Dentist in Nashville, TN 37205


## Dr. K.B. Parkes

## Meet Dr. Parkes​

Dr. K.B. Parkes is a third generation dentist from Nashville. He is a graduate of Montgomery Bell Academy (2000), the University of Mississippi, and the University of Mississippi School of Dentistry. K.B. discovered his passion for cosmetic dentist services in dental school and was awarded the American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry Award in 2009. After graduation, K.B. joined Drs. Waltemath as a cosmetic dentist, and is honored to carry on the tradition of one of the most trusted and respected dental practices in Nashville and Belle Meade.

During his professional career, K.B. has been on the forefront of single-visit dentistry and procedures, including crowns, veneers, [bridges](https://www.ifdnashville.com/procedures/dental-bridge), and implant restorations. Using CEREC technology, most treatments are able to be completed in one appointment, which Dr. Parkes’ patients love. K.B. has been voted by his peers for four consecutive years as one of Nashville’s Top Dentists by Nashville Lifestyle Magazine. He is committed to learning the best techniques and finding the best technology to provide his patients with the highest quality of care possible.

## Meet Dr. Parkes: A Third-Generation Dentist

Dr. K.B. Parkes was born into a family of dentists. He grew up observing how his father and grandfather helped people through oral health care, and how involved they were in the community. Now, Dr. Parkes strives to do the same by making his patients as comfortable as possible and helping solve their oral health issues.

Dr. Parkes is a volunteer at the Interfaith Dental Clinic, and is a co-creator of Hapi Water, whose mission is to fight the growing epidemic of childhood obesity and cavities by providing children with healthy, sugar-free drink choices. He is a Board Member of the Nashville Dental Society, and is a Delegate of the Tennessee Dental Association. Dr. Parkes is also a member of the American Dental Association, the Academy of General Dentistry, the American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry, and the Millennial and Volunteer Study Clubs. At Ole Miss, K.B. was awarded the M-Club Scholarship and was inducted into the National Society of Collegiate Scholars and the Alpha Epsilon Delta Premedical Honor Society. He also served for two years as President of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity and was a member of the Ole Miss Rugby team.

“I’m often asked how I chose my profession. I usually will laugh and jokingly say, ‘when you are a giant nerd who loves science and golf, dentistry just comes naturally!’ But the real answer is the influence of my family. Both my father and grandfather are dentists, and both are men I admire greatly. They taught me that dentistry is one of the best professions to help others and create lasting friendships. I still meet people who tell me that my grandfather changed their life by giving them a beautiful smile. I have learned many lessons from them which helped me excel from Montgomery Bell Academy, to Ole Miss undergraduate and dental schools, and now professionally. Away from the office, my favorite times are spent with my wife, Blair, and our sons, K.B. Of course, you may find me playing golf or reading about science!”-Dr. ParkesCosmetic Dentist


Dental Implants in Nashville | Restore Your Smile


# Dental Implants

## Dental Implants in Nashville Are the Top Choice

## FOR TOOTH REPLACEMENT

Though there are many restorative options to choose from, patients at Iroquois Dentistry who choose dental implants in Nashville can benefit from several significant advantages, including:
[A Lasting Solution](#collapse-54ca73f694c667284be1)

Titanium implants are extremely durable. The restoration placed on your implant could last ten years or more with proper maintenance, but with the same appropriate hygiene and routine dental visits, dental implants will typically last the rest of your life.

[Incredible Stability](#collapse-e9b3307694c667284be1)

Because each titanium post functions as a substitute for the roots of a missing tooth, your restoration will never slip out of place. Implants allow you to eat all of your favorite foods without any restrictions, as well as speak and smile with confidence.

[Natural Appearance](#collapse-262c978694c667284be1)

The restoration supported by your implants will look and function just like natural teeth. At Iroquois Dentistry, our doctors use advanced medical-grade materials to craft your restoration. This allows us to provide the natural-looking appearance you deserve.

[Improved Jaw Health](#collapse-ec86c55694c667284be1)

By replacing dental roots, implants will also perform the same function in your overall oral health. As you chew and speak, the posts will send regenerative signals to your jaw, triggering new bone growth to prevent bone recession and further tooth loss.

Overview

A missing tooth or teeth can have a significant impact on the appearance of your smile, the function of your bite, and your self-confidence.

Dental implants in Nashville provide a stable base for advanced restorations so that you can bring form, function, and health back to your smile.

Our team at [Iroquois Dentistry in Nashville, TN](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Iroquois+Dentistry/@36.1043153,-86.8687329,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x886463dcdd493741:0xb1d7f062053187a6!8m2!3d36.1043153!4d-86.8687329!16s%2Fg%2F11f9j8gbkj?shorturl=1), can revitalize your smile with dental implants.

“Dr. Smith along with Tammy his assistant, did an outstanding job preparing me for my implant.  They made sure that I was completely comfortable and every question was answered… I HIGHLY recommend Iroqous Dentistry to help you with all your dental needs.”— [By Google Reviewer ​tina stokes](https://goo.gl/maps/n69Ht5uJ5ESApgk4A)

If you are missing teeth, titanium implants offer the most secure and realistic restorations available. That is why Iroquois Dentistry in Nashville, TN, proudly offers state-of-the-art dental implant treatment.Dental implants can replace a missing tooth or teeth and protect your long-term oral health by stopping the bone loss that naturally accompanies tooth loss.

## Dental Crowns

A d[ental crown](https://www.ifdnashville.com/same-day-crowns/) is a life-like restoration that fits securely onto your implant. A dental crown will look and function like a natural tooth.

## Dental Bridges

[Dental bridges](https://www.ifdnashville.com/procedures/dental-bridge/) are restorations that can replace multiple missing neighboring teeth. We can secure them to implants to create a lasting solution.

## Implant-Supported Dentures

[Implant-supported dentures](https://www.ifdnashville.com/procedures/dental-implants/dentures/) can replace a full arch of missing teeth. Your dentures will remain firmly in place while eating and speaking when secured by dental implants.

## Our Patients Recommend Our Quality Care

## "I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRACTICE."

I LOVED my experience at Iroquois today. The staff were very sweet and professional. Dr.Smith did such a great job, and I’ve never had such an easy experience at any dentist office! Actually looking forward to getting my cleaning soon! Six stars!Jordan Pruitt Fuente 2022
Always a pleasant experience! All of the staff is super friendly and helpful. I’ve been going there for 6 years now and I HIGHLY recommend this practice. Susan Sharbel 2022
I've had both an implant through Iroquois and two minor procedures. The absolute care and detail are outstanding ... As soon as KB started, I knew it would look completely different with him because of the precision tools/techniques he was using. He didn't settle for 'eh, it'll work'.Sheri Traxler

## Get Your Restorations

IN A SINGLE VISIT

Our practice uses [CEREC® technology](https://www.ifdnashville.com/same-day-crowns) and years of experience to craft natural-looking restorations conveniently, quickly, and with the utmost precision. Our Nashville dentists can oversee your entire dental implant treatment in one location to ensure the highest level of care possible.

## Same-Day Restorations

## with CEREC

Once you have healed following [implant surgery](https://www.ifdnashville.com/procedures/dental-implants/procedure), we will use our CEREC system to take impressions of your gums and natural teeth. These highly detailed scans allow us to design a restoration that will have a near-perfect fit and an incredibly natural-looking appearance. Your crown, bridge, or denture will then connect directly to the implants using the abutments or specialized dental cement. If you are receiving an implant-supported crown or bridge, we may be able to conveniently create your restoration in our office in a single appointment.

The Iroquois Dentistry team looks forward to welcoming you.

## Schedule an Implant Consultation

Dental implants and implant-supported restorations are an important investment in yourself. It is important to visit a practitioner who can provide the best possible results. Our office has provided outstanding care to Nashville, TN, since 1946. Each of our dentists, Dr. K.B. Parkes, Dr. Tyler Smith, Dr. Jody Glover, and Dr. Megan Allred, are experienced in implant dentistry and know how to create personalized, beautiful, and natural-looking restorations.

[Request a Consultation](https://book.modento.io/iroquois-dentistry/patient-details)

## Are Dental Implants Right for You?

Implants are [surgically placed into the jaw](https://www.ifdnashville.com/procedures/dental-implants/procedure) to replace the roots of missing teeth. These small, titanium posts can support all types of dental restorations from [crowns](https://www.ifdnashville.com/procedures/dental-implants/crowns) to [dentures](https://www.ifdnashville.com/procedures/dental-implants/dentures). The right implant-supported prosthetic for you will depend on the degree of tooth loss you have experienced. If you only have one missing tooth, an implant-supported crown will be sufficient. An [implant-supported bridge](https://www.ifdnashville.com/procedures/dental-implants/bridges) or denture is required if you need to replace multiple teeth or even a full dental arch. In order to qualify for dental implants, you must meet certain criteria, including:

### Good Bone Health

In order to receive dental implants, it is essential that you have a healthy jawbone. Strong bone tissue will support the titanium posts for long-term results. If you have suffered significant jawbone atrophy, this may affect your candidacy for treatment. To improve your candidacy, you may be able to undergo a bone graft or sinus lift. This allows our dentists to create a solid base for implant treatment.

### Non-Smoker

Smoking has a negative effect on your body's immune system and can inhibit your ability to heal properly following implant surgery. It can also increase the risk of experiencing implant failure. Smokers who are considering restoring a missing tooth or teeth with implants need to quit several months in advance of surgery. Those who are willing to quit need to do so permanently to avoid any complications.

### Free of Periodontal Disease

If you have gum disease, you will need to undergo professional periodontal treatment before beginning the implant process. Healthy gum tissue is essential to provide a strong foundation for the successful placement of implants.

### Generally Healthy

Health conditions such as diabetes can increase the risks of surgery and inhibit healing and recovery. Fortunately, healthy patients who have their diabetes under control can expect success rates equal to those without diabetes.

## If You Are Missing a Tooth,

## YOU ARE NOT ALONE

Adults lose an average of 7 teeth by the age of 64

*According to the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research

## Dental Implants Are a Superior Solution

DR. JODY GLOVER EXPLAINS THE DENTAL IMPLANT PROCESS

Dental implants are a long-lasting tooth replacement option with many benefits. Our doctors make the dental implant process comfortable, and patients often feel little discomfort following the procedure. Our experienced dentists have undergone extra training to provide full dental implant treatment. From surgery to restoration placement, our dentists are there for you every step of the way. At Iroquois Dentistry, we consider anyone with missing teeth a good candidate for implants.

## The Process: Dental Implants in Nashville

WHAT TO EXPECT DURING TREATMENT

Anyone missing teeth is a good candidate for this high-quality dental treatment.

## Consultation

## 1

You will first meet with one of our dentists to review your oral health needs and goals. They will create a customized treatment plan to restore your smile.

## Implant Surgery

## 2

Your titanium implants are precisely placed in the jawbone using surgical guides during a minor outpatient surgery at our Nashville, TN, office. Sedation is available to ensure your comfort.

## Osseointegration

## 3

Over the next four to six months, the titanium posts will fuse with your bone during a process called osseointegration. Eventually, the dental implants will act like the roots of the missing tooth and become a permanent part of your jaw. You will be fitted with temporary fixed teeth while your jawbone heals.

## Abutment Placement

## 4

After this first healing period, your doctor will place an abutment on the implant or implants. Abutments are small connector pieces that are used to attach a restoration such as a dental crown. A second recovery period will be needed so your gums can heal around the abutments.

## Restoration Attachment

## 5

Once you have fully healed from the abutment placement (about two weeks later), we can attach your replacement tooth, bridge, or denture to your implants. Although dentures generally require a couple of weeks or more to craft off-site, we can often provide same-day crowns and bridges using our in-office CEREC milling machine.


## Are Missing Teeth Impacting Your Life?

## BRING BACK YOUR CONFIDENCE

Missing teeth affect more than just your smile. Tooth loss can make it hard to eat and can even alter how you talk. Over time, your face may look aged as bone deteriorates. Gaps caused by missing teeth let other teeth shift out of place, leading to additional dental problems.

Dental implants, especially when placed promptly by one of the skilled dentists at [Iroquois Dentistry](https://www.ifdnashville.com/) in Nashville, TN, can restore the simple pleasures you’ve been missing and avoid a cascade of oral health problems.

The compassionate, top-rated dentists at our Nashville practice use proven methods and the latest, exacting technology to create beautiful smiles and bring lifelong benefits to your health.

[Send us a message](https://www.ifdnashville.com/contact) or call us today to learn how you can turn back the clock and restore your smile:

### [(615) 298-2040](tel:+(615) 298-2040)

## Can You See the Difference?

## RESTORATIONS LOOK AND FUNCTION LIKE NATURAL TEETH

Before — The integrated dental implant acts as an anchor for a single restoration in this case.
After — With the custom crown in place, the results restore function and look completely natural.

## We Use Top-Tier Materials

## AND ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

Our dentists use only top-tier materials for our dental implants to create results that are long-lasting and beautiful.

### [Nobel Implants](tel:615-298-2040)

We rely on Nobel implants that have a proven track record of success. Nobel was an early provider of implants and their long-standing reputation speaks to the quality of their work. With good oral hygiene habits, your Nobel implants can last a lifetime.

### [Latest Equipment](https://ifdnashville.com/contact/)

We use state-of-the-art technology to create a precise 3D impression of your mouth and a custom surgical guide. This technology takes the guesswork out of implant treatment and allows us to accurately place the titanium posts.

### [Precision Placement](https://ifdnashville.com/consultation/)

Our cutting-edge procedures ensure predictable outcomes by placing your implant in the most advantageous position. Our precision extends to the creation of your restoration to ensure it is functional, natural-looking, and long-lasting.

## Customized and Precise Implant Placement

THE BENEFITS OF GUIDED IMPLANT SURGERY

Guided implant surgery is an improved form of dental implant surgery that allows our dentists to create a customized surgical strategy. This cutting-edge technique allows our dentists to:

- Provide more accurate implant placement
- Reduce disruption to the bone and surrounding tissue
- Improve success rates for integration of the implant
- Provide better aesthetic results
- Minimize risk of damage to nerves, sinus cavities, and neighboring teeth
- Precisely control alignment angles when replacing multiple teeth

## Are You Worried About Surgery?

## WE ARE TRAINED AND LICENSED IN SEDATION DENTISTRY

Modern-day dentistry and the use of state-of-the-art technology lets patients receive treatment for missing teeth with little to no discomfort. Our dentists use precise surgical guides that reduce the impact on the jawbone and surrounding tissue. This leads to less pain and quicker recovery times.

We understand any surgery can be concerning, so our Nashville practice offers three forms of sedation dentistry tailored to your needs:

[Learn How Sedation Provides Worry-Free Dental Care](https://ifdnashville.com/sedation-dentistry/)

### Nitrous Oxide Sedation

Also known as laughing gas, nitrous oxide allows you to be relaxed and comfortable during surgery while still being aware of your surroundings.

### Oral Conscious Sedation

Oral sedation is given through prescribed medication that you will take before arriving at our office. You should be completely relaxed by your arrival.

### IV Sedation

IV sedation is the strongest form of sedation dentistry. Many patients who choose IV sedation are so relaxed during treatment they fall asleep.

## We Customize Our Treatments to Your Unique Needs

Iroquois Dentistry has been a part of the fabric of Nashville since 1946. We make a point of getting to know our patients so that we can cater to their unique needs and address concerns they may be hesitant to talk about. By taking the time to get to know our patients, we are able to tailor our services to their goals and maximize their oral health.

## Implants vs. Other Procedures

[Dentures](https://www.ifdnashville.com/procedures/dentures) and [traditional bridges](https://www.ifdnashville.com/procedures/dental-bridge) are the standards for replacing lost teeth and they have been widely used for decades. Plus, the lower initial cost can make them appear attractive. However, when comparing implants to these traditional methods, it’s important to also weigh lifetime costs and the impact of these older procedures on your oral health. Dental implants are:

### Designed to Last a Lifetime

When cared for properly, dental implants can last 40 or more years. The restoration will need to be replaced periodically, but the implant itself can last a lifetime.

### Proven to Be More Reliable

Studies have shown that bridges have a failure rate as high as 10 percent in just three years. On the other hand, dental implants have a long-term success rate of more than 95 percent.

### More Convenient

Traditional dentures do not stop bone loss. As bone is lost, your dentures will need to be adjusted to avoid slipping and painful rubbing that can cause sores. Over time, the costs of relining and adjusting your denture will add up.

### Better for Your Health

Without implants, dentures and bridges do not stimulate the bone in your jaw to grow and replenish itself. This deterioration can cause new oral health problems while also giving your face a sunken, aged look. Implants are the one and only treatment that can stop this bone loss that leads to additional dental problems.

## Are You Concerned About Costs?

HOW OUR NASHVILLE PRACTICE CAN HELP

Implants are rarely covered by insurance so we understand our patients’ concerns about costs. The initial cost of dental implants can appear intimidating. That’s why we offer a bundle package that allows us to provide dental implants at a much more affordable rate.

It also helps to understand that the process of placing dental implants is broken up into two stages: the surgical placement of the implants and placement of the restoration. Because the two steps are generally four months apart, the patient is able to spread out the cost over a period of time.

We also offer flexible payment methods in addition to our bundle package that reduces costs. When insurance doesn’t cover all your costs, the rest can usually be managed with:

- CareCredit® financing
- Our in-house low-interest and interest-free payment plans (some restrictions may apply)

Same-Day Crowns Nashville | Iroquois Dentistry


# Same-Day Crowns


Getting a traditional dental crown to restore a tooth after decay or trauma can be a complicated process that takes weeks to complete.

Thanks to our advanced dental technology, you can get a beautiful, durable crown in just one appointment at our Nashville, TN, office.

You can skip temporary crowns and get your smile back faster with a same-day dental crown at Iroquois Dentistry.

## How We Make Same-Day Treatment Possible

## INTRODUCING THE CEREC SYSTEM

CEREC® is an all-in-one system for the design and production of lifelike and durable dental restorations. If you need a crown to protect a single tooth or a [dental bridge](https://www.ifdnashville.com/procedures/dental-bridge) to replace one to three consecutive missing teeth, our CEREC system can fabricate your restoration in a single day.

Let’s break down how our Nashville dentists can use CEREC to give you a high-quality, time-efficient solution for your dental issues:

## 3D Digital Scans


Your dentist will use an intraoral scanner to capture a detailed digital image of your smile in just moments, eliminating wait times and the need for messy dental putty used for traditional impressions.

## Designing the Crown


The digital scans will be processed with CAD (computer-aided design) software, which will create a blueprint for your crown or bridge based on your bite and the shape of your natural teeth.

## Crown Fabrication


Our CAM (computer-aided manufacturing) milling unit will use the blueprint to fabricate your crown or bridge from a durable material. This technology helps us ensure that your restoration is created with the highest degree of accuracy, so it achieves a seamless look with the rest of your teeth.

## The Unbeatable Benefits

## OF SAME-DAY CEREC CROWNS

We use CEREC technology at our [Nashville practice](https://www.ifdnashville.com/nashville-dentist-office) because of the many advantages it can offer our patients. By choosing same-day crowns from Iroquois Dentistry, you can reap benefits such as:

## Saving Time

Many dentists have to send impressions to an outside lab for crown fabrication, meaning that you would have to wear temporary crowns during a 2- to 3-week waiting period. Thanks to our in-house technology, your natural-looking crowns can be ready in a single office visit, allowing you to enjoy your beautiful, functional smile much quicker.

## Enhancing Your Appearance

We typically use IPS e.max® instead of porcelain to craft our same-day crowns. This material is stronger than porcelain and is one of the top choices for restorative dentistry thanks to its incredibly lifelike qualities. IPS e.max mimics the color, translucency, and shine of a natural tooth, meaning that your crown will blend in seamlessly with your smile.

## Restoring Dental Function

Serious chips, fractures, and other dental flaws can weaken your teeth and make chewing and speaking uncomfortable or painful. Our same-day CEREC crowns can quickly protect and strengthen teeth that have been damaged. You can walk out of our office with renewed confidence in the stability of your smile.

## Enjoying Lasting Results

The material we use to craft our CEREC prosthetics is stain-resistant and incredibly durable, so you won’t have to worry about replacing your crowns for years to come. In fact, a [2008 study published in Operative Dentistry](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18833853/) found that 85 percent of CEREC-made restorations remained fully intact after 10 years.

## You Don't Have To Wait To Restore Your Smile

## CONTACT US FOR SAME-DAY TREATMENT

Whether you have structural dental damage that makes eating and speaking a challenge or cosmetic flaws that make you feel self-conscious about your smile, our same-day crowns can do wonders for the function and appearance of your teeth.

We can restore your smile with crowns in just a fraction of the time as other practices that don’t use CEREC technology. To learn if same-day crowns are right for you, get in touch with our Nashville, TN, practice by [sending us a message](https://www.ifdnashville.com/contact) or calling: (615) 298-2040

## Are Dental Crowns Right for You?

Some of the most common reasons we recommend crowns for our patients include:

- Protect Damaged Teeth
- Mask Dental Discoloration
- Support a Tooth After a Root Canal
- Improve the Look of Misshapen Teeth

## What About Dental Implants?

In addition to traditional same-day crowns, our practice can also create [implant-supported crowns](https://www.ifdnashville.com/procedures/dental-implants/crowns) and [bridges](https://www.ifdnashville.com/procedures/dental-implants/bridges) to quickly fill gaps in your smile.

Once you have healed from [implant placement surgery](https://www.ifdnashville.com/procedures/dental-implants/procedure) after about four months, our dentists can replace your temporary restoration with a lifelike permanent restoration. Our CEREC milling system can fabricate your implant-supported dental crown during the same appointment as your scans, and you can leave our Nashville office with a beautifully restored smile.

[Learn More About Dental Implants](https://ifdnashville.com/procedures/dental-implants/)

## The Same-Day Crown Process

You can have a brand-new permanent dental crown in less than 2 hours.

## Numbing the Area


Dental crown treatment is not painful and can usually be performed with just local anesthesia; however, if you have dental anxiety or sensitivity, your dentist can administer nitrous sedation to help you achieve deep relaxation during your procedure.

## Shaping the Tooth


Your dentist will remove any damaged or decayed dental tissue and reshape the tooth to better accommodate the crown.

## Digital Scans


Once your tooth has been shaped, your dentist will take a digital scan of the treatment area, which will be sent to our milling system to guide the fabrication of your crown.


It can take just minutes to create a crown with our CEREC milling machine. While you wait, feel free to listen to music with a pair of our comfortable headphones or watch a show on TV, which we have in every treatment room.

## Placing the Crown


When your crown is ready, your dentist will secure it to your tooth with dental cement. Your crown will be designed with the highest level of precision, but your dentist might make a few minor adjustments to ensure the absolute best fit between the crown and your tooth.

[I'm READY For a More Complete Smile!](/contact)

## How Much Do Dental Crowns Cost?

The average cost for same-day dental crowns at our Nashville, TN, practice starts at $1725 per crown; however, your final cost can vary depending on whether you received preparatory treatments like core build-up or [root canal](https://www.ifdnashville.com/procedures/root-canal-therapy).

## Insurance

You may be wondering if same-day crowns are covered by insurance. Fortunately, any crown used for restorative purposes, like protecting a damaged tooth or replacing an older crown, will likely receive at least partial coverage; however, a crown used for cosmetic reasons, like enhancing the appearance of a stained tooth, will not be covered. We accept most dental insurance plans.

## Financing

If you are uninsured or paying out-of-pocket for crown dentistry services, we have financing options for you. We work with [CareCredit®](https://www.carecredit.com/go/DPK746), a healthcare lender that can help you secure a low- or no-interest loan to cover your treatment. CareCredit can break the cost of your same-day crowns into smaller monthly installments for easy payment.


Veneers | Iroquois Dentistry | Dentist in Nashville, TN 37205


# Same-day Porcelain Veneers


Chipped, worn, or slightly crooked teeth can affect the attractiveness of your smile and make you feel self-conscious.

Custom-made dental veneers are ultra-thin porcelain shells that can conceal imperfections, giving you a dazzling, youthful smile.

Our dentists at Iroquois Dentistry in Nashville, TN, can transform your smile and elevate your confidence through dental veneers.

## Learn More About Dental Veneers

## FROM ONE OF OUR EXPERT DENTISTS

Dr. K.B. Parkes at Iroquois Dentistry discusses the benefits of porcelain veneers and what you can expect after treatment. Our practice offers both porcelain veneers and composite veneers, which are applied in a procedure called bonding. Composite veneers are made of tooth-colored resin that is directly applied to your teeth to conceal dental flaws. Although composite veneers can provide a flattering enhancement, porcelain veneers can last longer and look far more realistic than composite resin.
[Video Gallery](https://ifdnashville.com/video/)

## What Dental Flaws Can Veneers Conceal?

## STAINS, CHIPS, GAPS, AND MORE

Dental veneers can cover mild to moderate cosmetic flaws that can make you feel self-conscious. Once placed, your veneers will blend in with your surrounding natural teeth. [Contact our Nashville, TN, practice](https://www.ifdnashville.com/contact) if you are unhappy with any imperfections in your smile, such as:
[Misalignment](#collapse-54ca73f694c55b78fbca)

Dental veneers can cover minor orthodontic issues including gaps and rotated teeth. However, you may need orthodontic treatment for severe malocclusion.

[Discoloration](#collapse-e9b3307694c55b78fbca)

Dental veneers conceal intrinsic stains and discolored teeth that cannot be addressed with teeth whitening.

[Damage](#collapse-262c978694c55b7908dc)

Veneers can cover a worn, chipped, or cracked tooth that is still structurally strong.

[Irregular Shape](#collapse-2c73b3a694c55b7908dc)

Dental veneers can restore balance by covering a tooth that is too small, too large, or misshapen.

## Top 5 Benefits of Porcelain Veneers

Men and women who receive veneers at [our Nashville, TN, dental practice](https://www.ifdnashville.com/nashville-dentist-office) find that veneers offer many life-changing benefits.

[Versatile Applications](#collapse-54ca73f694c55b79474f)

Dental veneers can conceal a wide range of imperfections at once. Without this treatment, you would have to undergo several cosmetic procedures to address your individual concerns and the process could be time-consuming.

[Stunning Transformations](#collapse-e9b3307694c55b79474f)

These porcelain restorations can make your smile (and your whole appearance) look brighter and younger. A bright, healthy-looking smile can rejuvenate your facial features and help you make a good first impression.

[Long-Lasting Results](#collapse-262c978694c55b79474f)

When you brush, floss, and visit the dentist regularly, your dental veneers can remain a part of your smile for up to a decade. Porcelain is incredibly durable and stain-resistant, so it can maintain its bright white color for years to come.

[Custom-Designed Treatments](#collapse-91adf39694c55b79474f)

​Every patient has their veneers custom-designed to match the unique aesthetic qualities of their teeth. We carefully select the porcelain that matches your natural tooth enamel and blends seamlessly into your smile.

[Same-Day Results](#collapse-5dc94c9694c55b79474f)

Our Nashville practice uses CEREC® technology to design, craft, and place beautiful veneers in just one appointment. There is zero downtime, and you can resume your normal activities immediately after your visit to our office.

## Am I a Good Candidate for Porcelain Veneers?

### Sufficient Enamel

To be considered a good candidate for veneers, a certain amount of tooth enamel is required. In order for traditional veneers to fit over your teeth, a small amount of enamel must be removed. If you have significant erosion, you may be a better candidate for crowns.

### No Teeth Grinding

While porcelain is very strong, it is not unbreakable. Clenching and grinding your teeth, also known as bruxism, can put excessive stress on your porcelain restorations. If you suffer from bruxism, we can provide an oral appliance to help protect your veneers.

### Minor Alignment Issues

Veneers can conceal small gaps and minor misalignment in just one appointment. However, if you suffer from moderate to severe misalignment, orthodontic treatments such as SureSmile can help you straighten your smile more effectively than cosmetic dentistry.

### Ready for a Permanent Change

Traditional porcelain veneers require permanent alteration to the enamel of your teeth. This means that any tooth treated will require some sort of restoration to maintain its form and function. Therefore, you need to be committed to replacing your restorations every decade or so.

## Is Your Oral Health Affecting Your Candidacy?

## WE CAN HELP YOU PREPARE YOUR SMILE

If you suffer from oral health issues such as gum disease or tooth decay, you will need to have these treated by our Nashville dentists before receiving your porcelain veneers. We can provide treatment to restore your oral health before moving forward with any of our [cosmetic treatments](https://www.ifdnashville.com/cosmetic-dentistry).

We can also recommend alternative procedures such as [bonding](https://www.ifdnashville.com/procedures/dental-bonding), which uses composite resin instead of porcelain. It can achieve similar effects without the same candidacy restrictions as dental veneers.

## Our Cosmetic Dentists Use Cutting-Edge CEREC Technology

## BEAUTIFUL VENEERS IN ONE APPOINTMENT

Our Nashville, TN, [dental office](https://www.ifdnashville.com/) utilizes the state-of-the-art CEREC system to design and create lifelike dental veneers and [crowns](https://www.ifdnashville.com/dental-crowns) in one office visit. Using innovative CAD/CAM (computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing) technology, we scan your teeth and design your veneers on a monitor before your very eyes.

The CEREC milling device will carve the thin shells from tooth-colored ceramic, carefully matching the color and natural shine of your tooth enamel. Because production happens on-site, we have complete control over every aspect of production, allowing us to provide veneers of superior quality. Outsourcing veneer production to a dental lab can take weeks to complete. While most dental practices only outsource, our patients have the option of completing treatment in as little as two hours.

With CEREC, the prep, design, production, and placement happens in a single appointment.

## What to Expect During Your Appointment


Before beginning your dental treatment, our team will discuss your cosmetic goals. Together, we can design restorations that achieve your desired effects. You will be a key player in this process and you can make suggestions and request changes until you are completely satisfied with the expected final results.

## Tooth Preparation


Your dentist will first need to remove a small amount of enamel in order for your veneers to lay flat. This step can also help ensure a strong bond between your tooth and the porcelain. Our doctors use conservative and gentle techniques, preserving as much of your natural tooth structure as possible. The preparation process should involve minimal discomfort, even without local anesthesia. However, we do offer sedation for anxious patients.

## Fabrication


We provide convenient, same-day restorations with our CEREC milling machine. Using CEREC technology, we can prep, design, create, and place the restorations in as little as two hours.

## Placement


Once your veneers are finished, your dentist will ensure that you are happy with the look and feel of your restored smile. We can make any necessary changes to provide the most customized and lifelike results. When you are satisfied with the appearance and fit of your veneers, we will securely bond them in place for a completely transformed smile.

## How to Care for Your Porcelain Veneers

Even though porcelain veneers are incredibly durable, if you want them to last as long as possible, you must care for them properly. Here are some tips from our Nashville practice to help you maintain your porcelain veneers:

Practice Proper Oral Hygiene

Porcelain veneers do not decay, but the teeth that support them remain as susceptible as ever. Brush twice daily for two minutes, and floss once each day to give your veneers a healthy foundation. You may also consider using a fluoride mouth rinse once daily to further protect your teeth.

Avoid Drinks That Stain Teeth

While porcelain veneers are stain-resistant, the adhesive used to keep them attached is not. Drinking coffee, soda, and other dyed beverages can cause the edge of your veneers to become yellowed or darkened. Minimize foods and drinks that stain; brush immediately after you indulge.

Don’t Use Your Teeth as Tools

While porcelain veneers are durable, they’re not quite as strong as regular teeth. Your veneers could chip or become damaged if you chew on hard objects like ice, your fingernails, pens, etc. Now is a great time to break bad habits and start taking the best possible care of your new smile!

## Are You Looking To Brighten Your Smile Before Veneers?

## OUR NASHVILLE PRACTICE OFFERS TEETH WHITENING

Our porcelain veneers are matched to your surrounding teeth so they can blend in with your smile. By whitening your natural teeth first, our dentists can color-match your veneers to your newly whitened teeth, giving you a bright, white smile. Follow the same care instructions as you would after veneers (like avoiding drinks that stain teeth and practicing good oral hygiene) to maintain the whitening effects before and after your veneers are placed.

Teeth whitening is also a great alternative for patients looking to enhance their smiles without making the change permanent. Our Nashville practice offers several types of in-office and at-home treatments to whiten your smile by several shades in a single appointment. In fact, our in-office treatments can whiten your teeth up to eight shades in under an hour, making them the perfect enhancement before an upcoming event.

[Contact our Nashville, TN, office](https://www.ifdnashville.com/contact) to learn more about our [teeth whitening](https://www.ifdnashville.com/teeth-whitening) options.

## How Much Do Veneers Cost?

On average, our veneers cost start at $1,843 per unit. Keep in mind that porcelain veneers give you a high return on your investment, masking various cosmetic imperfections with one simple solution. All of our procedures are offered at fair and competitive prices which we will be happy to explain in detail at your consultation.
In general, the price of treatment varies depending on several factors such as materials, preparatory procedures, and how many teeth are being treated. You can get an exact estimate after the dentist examines your teeth at your initial appointment. We can discuss your needs and goals and work with you to create a payment plan that is compatible with your budget.

Our experienced dentists and staff will take the time to listen to your needs and goals so they can suggest the best treatment and answer any questions you may have about payments and financing. We want you to leave our office with a smile you’ll be proud to show off.

## We Give You Options

## TO MAKE TREATMENT MORE AFFORDABLE

We realize that patients might have concerns about affording this treatment. [Iroquois Dentistry](https://www.ifdnashville.com/) strives to help patients with all budgets afford the cost of treatment. Read more about your options to make veneers more affordable…

### Dental Insurance

While insurance typically will not cover the cost of cosmetic treatment, it is important to know that our office accepts most major providers. We will work with your insurance carrier directly to see what is covered and if we can reduce your out-of-pocket costs.

### CareCredit Financing

Our practice accepts CareCredit® to help finance your procedure and reduce your initial out-of-pocket expenses. Most patients qualify for low-interest financing plans and, in some cases, interest-free plans.


Our Practice accepts Proceed Finance for qualifying patients. Prequalification just takes a few minutes to complete and patients receive an instant decision.

### In-House Plans

Our practice offers in-house financing plans for qualified patients with low-interest and interest-free payment plans. A member of our friendly staff will work directly with you to develop a plan with an affordable monthly rate.

### Lower Cost Options

We can also provide affordable alternatives to dental veneers. While bonding may not be as natural-looking as ceramic and porcelain options, it is more affordable and can still produce fantastic results. Ask the dentist about the materials available within your price range.

Emergency Dentist – Fast, Reliable Same-Day Dental Care


# Emergency Dentistry​

## Emergency Dentistry: We're Always a Phone Call Away

The doctors at Iroquois Dentistry are available 24/7 for emergency dentistry visits. In fact, at least two doctors are on call and nearby at all times. Whether you have a chipped tooth, a broken tooth, or are experiencing severe pain, an emergency dentist can provide the necessary care.


A sudden dental injury can affect your appearance, comfort, and overall oral health. Fortunately, emergency dental care not only restores your smile but also helps reduce pain and anxiety.

Additionally, it can prevent the need for unnecessary ER visits, offering a more efficient solution.

The emergency dentists at Iroquois Dentistry in Nashville, TN, can resolve your dental emergency, often the same day…

## The Importance of Prompt Attention

A knocked-out or broken tooth, severe gum or cheek damage, or intense dental pain requires immediate treatment. Call [Iroquois Dentistry](https://www.ifdnashville.com/) at [(615) 298-2040](http://16155513639) for fast care.

Our skilled dentists use advanced tools like laser dentistry and CEREC® scanners and software to restore your smile in one visit, helping prevent further damage and costly treatments.

Untreated dental issues can lead to infections and further damage, increasing treatment costs, dentist visits, and recovery time.


## We Prioritize Your Comfort

Dental emergencies are often incredibly painful; however, we offer sedation to help relieve the pain and keep you comfortable throughout your visit. This ensures that you receive the necessary care while minimizing discomfort.

[Learn How Sedation Can Help You](/sedation-dentistry)

## What to Do When Dental Emergencies Occur

If you have ongoing pain, like a severe toothache, seek emergency dental care right away. In the meantime, these tips can help keep you calm and comfortable until your visit:

### Knocked-Out Tooth

If one or more of your teeth are knocked out due to an injury, you must act quickly to give our dentists the best chance of re-implanting it.
First, avoid touching the tooth's roots and keep it moist by placing it in a baggie or container with milk or saliva.
If possible, you can also try to put it back in place until you arrive at our state-of-the-art Nashville, TN, dental office.

### Broken Teeth

Although minor chips or cracks can be easily concealed by our dentists with dental bonding or porcelain veneers at your next appointment, more importantly, serious breaks need immediate attention from an emergency dentist.
In the meantime, to minimize pain on your way to our Nashville practice, rinse with warm water, apply an ice pack or take pain medication, and if necessary, use gauze or a wet tea bag to stop and absorb bleeding.

### Cracked Teeth

You need to see an emergency dentist especially if you crack a tooth.
After all, this injury is difficult to assess on your own since the tooth may look intact but hurt under pressure or feel extremely sensitive when you drink something hot or cold.
Moreover, consistent tooth pain may also mean nerve damage has occurred or a nerve ending is exposed.
Therefore, timely dental care can restore the tooth and protect your overall oral health.

### Soft Tissue Injury

Due to the many blood vessels in your mouth, injuries to your tongue, lips, or cheeks usually heal quickly.
If trauma occurs to the inside of the mouth, rinse with salt water or hydrogen peroxide to clear the blood and assess the injury.
Next, apply pressure with a clean cloth, cold compress, or ice to control bleeding.
Finally, seek care from our emergency dentists if bleeding is severe, the cut is deep, or there’s a puncture through your lips.

Before — A knocked-out tooth creates a gap, which can not only impact dental function but also disrupt your ability to bite and chew properly. Consequently, this can affect your overall oral health and comfort.

After — A restored smile can significantly protect both your appearance and overall health. Moreover, it helps maintain your confidence and ensures proper dental function.

## Was One of Your Teeth Knocked Out?

## WE CAN RESTORE YOUR HEALTH & CONFIDENCE

A knocked-out tooth can be extremely painful, damaging to your smile, and affect your ability to chew and speak properly. Our emergency dentists may be able to save your tooth by re-implanting it. If not, we provide traditional [dental bridges](https://www.ifdnashville.com/procedures/dental-bridge) and [dental implants](https://www.ifdnashville.com/procedures/dental-implants) to complete your smile.

## Broken Teeth Are Another Common Injury

A broken tooth is not only painful. This dental emergency could cause more damage and require costly treatment without immediate care.

This injury can expose nerve endings, making the tooth sensitive to temperature changes and allowing bacteria to penetrate the enamel, leading to infection..

## A Crown Popped Out While Flossing...

## IS THIS A DENTAL EMERGENCY?

While it’s usually not an emergency, if you’re in pain or unsure, contact [our office](https://www.ifdnashville.com/) [online](https://www.ifdnashville.com/contact) or at [(615) 298-2040](tel:+16155513639).

Prompt treatment for dental injuries or damage to restorations, like [crowns](https://www.ifdnashville.com/dental-crowns) or [bridges](https://www.ifdnashville.com/procedures/dental-bridge), helps prevent further damage.

## Other non-urgent dental issues include:

- Lost or Damaged Dental Fillings
- A Chipped Tooth

- Cracked Dentures
- Minor Dental Sensitivity or Toothache


## When Should I Go to the Hospital?

Extremely serious dental emergencies should be treated in a hospital emergency room. We may need to see you at [our Nashville office](https://www.ifdnashville.com/) in the following days in order to provide follow-up treatment or to examine how you are healing but if you have suffered an extremely traumatic injury to your mouth, please call 911 or have someone drive you to the nearest hospital. These emergency scenarios include:
