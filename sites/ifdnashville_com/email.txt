SUBJECT: Helping Iroquois Dentistry Patients Get Answers—Instantly

-----------------------------------------

Hi Dr. Parkes,

I’ve been exploring Iroquois Dentistry’s website and it’s clear you’ve built a welcoming, patient-focused dental practice that values clarity and comfort at every step.

At SlayDigital.ai, we help practices like yours make online communication even easier. We create simple, custom AI web agents that let visitors chat directly with your site’s content—providing instant, accurate answers to common (and complex) questions around the clock, without adding extra work for your team.

I took the liberty of putting together a live mock demo for you:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/ifdnashville_com

You’ll see a chat icon in the bottom-right corner—click it to open a chat box, and try asking questions as if you’re a visitor. The agent will answer using info already from your site.

Here are a few questions your patients might ask:
- What’s included in a same-day crown visit, and how quickly can I schedule?
- How does Iroquois Dentistry handle dental emergencies after hours?
- Are there payment plans or financing options for veneers or implants?
- Can you explain the process and recovery time for dental implants?
- Is sedation available for patients who are anxious about treatment?

Our agents reduce repetitive questions, help patients navigate your many services, and can free up your front desk to focus on care—not calls.

Would you be open to a quick chat? I’d be happy to discuss how something like this could fit your goals at Iroquois Dentistry.

Warm regards,  
Zac Slay
