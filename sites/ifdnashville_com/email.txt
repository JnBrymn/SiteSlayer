SUBJECT: Helping Your Nashville Dental Patients Get Answers Faster

Hi there,

I noticed your site is focused on helping Nashville patients regain their confidence with restorative dentistry—a valuable service, especially when people are unsure how to take the next step for their dental health.

I’m Zac from SlayDigital.ai. We build simple AI website agents that chat with your visitors and answer their questions using information that’s already on your site. This helps cut down repetitive inquiries and ensures people feel supported (even after hours).

Here’s a quick mock-up we made of your site with an embedded chat agent: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/ifdnashville_com

Just click the chat icon in the bottom right, then type a question—your visitors get real-time, clear answers straight from the info you already share.

You can try asking things like:
- What restorative dental services do you offer?
- Do you accept my dental insurance?
- How do I book a consultation?
- What should I do if I have a cracked tooth?
- Where is your office located in Nashville?

If this could help your patients or save you time, I’d be happy to chat further—no pressure. Thanks for your great work helping folks smile with confidence!

Best,
