SUBJECT: Helping Iroquois Dentistry Patients Find Fast, Clear Answers Online

-----------------------------------------

Hi Dr. Parkes,

I’m continually impressed by Iroquois Dentistry’s commitment to making dental care comfortable, clear, and accessible for the Nashville community. Your focus on patient relationships and technology stands out.

I’m Zac, founder of SlayDigital.ai. We help practices like yours reduce repetitive patient questions and streamline website engagement by building simple, custom AI chat agents that work directly with your existing site content—no jargon or complex integrations required.

I put together a quick demo using a mock version of your website: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/ifdnashville_com. If you click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner, a chat box will open—you can then type in questions, and the agent will answer using information already on your site.

You can try asking things like:
- “What does a same-day crown appointment look like at Iroquois Dentistry?”
- “How much do porcelain veneers cost, and are there financing options?”
- “What should I do if I have a dental emergency after hours?”
- “Do you offer sedation for anxious patients?”
- “How do I access patient forms or the portal before my visit?”

If you’re curious about making it even easier for patients to understand your services and take the next step, I’d love your thoughts or questions.

All the best,  
Zac Slay
