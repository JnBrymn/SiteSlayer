SUBJECT: Helping Patients Get Quick Answers—See a Simple Demo for Smiles Up

Hi Dr. Dudley,

I’m Zac Slay, founder of SlayDigital.ai. I noticed how much Smiles Up prioritizes accessibility and a stress-free experience—especially with your 24/7 emergency care. I wanted to share a simple way to help patients quickly get the answers they need right from your website, day or night.

We build custom AI chat agents that work with your site’s existing information—no jargon, just clear help for visitors. As an example, I set up a mock demo for Nashville Smiles Up here: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/nashvillesmilesup_com

You (or your team) can try it by clicking the chat icon in the bottom-right of the page. Just type a question and the agent will reply using your site’s info.

You can try asking things like:
- What should I do if I have a dental emergency after hours?
- How do I book an appointment or fill out new patient paperwork?
- What insurance plans and payment options do you accept?
- Is after-hours care available for children?
- What’s the cost and process for emergency dental visits?

If this feels like it could help your patients (and your team), I’d be happy to chat or answer any questions. No pressure at all—just wanted to offer a tool to make things even easier for Nashville Smiles Up.

Best,  
Zac Slay
