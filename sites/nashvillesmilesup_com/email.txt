Hi Dr. Dudley,

I’m impressed by Nashville Smiles Up’s commitment to accessible, around-the-clock dental care—especially how you support people during stressful emergencies.

I wanted to show you a simple way to help even more patients get answers right from your site, 24/7, without any extra effort from your team. At SlayDigital.ai, we build custom chat agents that use your existing site content to answer common questions—no jargon, just clarity and ease for your visitors.

Here’s a quick live example using a mock version of your site: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/nashvillesmilesup_com  
Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner and type any question; the agent will respond instantly with information pulled right from your website.

You can try asking things like:
- “What do I do if I have a dental emergency after hours?”
- “How do I pay the emergency deposit or what financing do you offer?”
- “Which dental services do you provide for new patients?”
- “When are walk-ins accepted, and what are your regular hours?”
- “How do I complete new patient paperwork before my visit?”

I’d be glad to share how this could help Smiles Up reduce repetitive calls, help patients prep for appointments, and let your team focus on care—even in the middle of the night.  

If you’re interested in seeing how this could fit with your practice, just let me know—I’ll keep it simple.

Best,  
Zac
