SUBJECT: Helping Patients Get Answers Fast—A Quick AI Demo for Nashville Smiles Up

-----------------------------------------
Hi Dr. Dudley,

I’m really impressed by Nashville Smiles Up’s commitment to being there for patients—day or night, emergencies or not. Your focus on access and comfort is clear in everything you do.

I wanted to share something simple we’ve built at SlayDigital.ai: custom web chat agents that let visitors get clear answers straight from your website, day or night. These agents live right on your site and answer questions using your own content, helping people quickly find what they need (and saving your team from answering the same things over and over).

To show you how it could work for Smiles Up, I built a quick demo using your own site: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/nashvillesmilesup_com.  
Just click the chat icon in the bottom right—then type any question (no sign-up needed) and the agent will respond based on your actual site info.

You can try it out by asking things like:
- How do I book an emergency dental appointment?
- What insurances and payment plans do you accept?
- How do after-hours visits work, and what’s the deposit?
- Which services do you offer for walk-in patients?
- What ages do you treat for emergency care?

If you think this could help patients connect faster—or just want a closer look—let me know. No strings attached, happy to answer any questions!

Best,  
Zac
