# Testimonial

Real Smiles. Real Stories.At Smiles Up Dentistry, every visit is about more than just teeth—it’s about trust, comfort, and care that lasts. Hear from our patients who’ve experienced the difference of compassionate dentistry done right.

I had a great experience at Smiles Up Dentistry. My cavities were cleaned out thoroughly, and the crown was placed on perfectly. The staff was very professional and focused the entire time. I could tell they really cared about getting the job done correctly, and that gave me a lot of confidence in their work. I highly recommend them if you’re looking for quality care done the right way. It’s going on 3 years being with them with no regrets.

Antonio M.
Patient

I was awake all night with the worst pain I've ever experienced, let alone tooth pain, and couldn't find any relief. I tried all the pain relievers and they didn't do anything, so finally I called Smiles Up at 4 in the morning and Drake Dudley met me at his office within an hour to extract the tooth. He's fast, friendly, honest, and very accommodating. He makes sure you're comfortable and doesn't waste any time getting down to business. Drake Dudley is the people's dentist and I highly recommend him.

Cameron A.
Paitent

I was so greatful to find this place. I woke up at 2 am in so much pain. I began to google 24/7 dentist in nashville, and Smiles Up Dentistry came up. I reached out at 2:22am, and was at the office by 3am. My tooth was extracted and i was in my car leaving by 339am. He was very informative and welcoming, yes even at the crack of dawn. This visit was a life saver. Thanks for everything! I will definitely be back for regular dental visits and maintenance.
