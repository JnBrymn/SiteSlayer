SUBJECT: An easy way to help Thingamabob visitors find what they're looking for

Hi there,

I love the nostalgic vibe you’re creating at Thingamabob—your #ThrowbackThursday posts are a fun way to bring memorable moments back to life! I wanted to reach out with a practical idea to help visitors quickly find info about your posts, merch, or any site details—without digging through pages or sending emails.

At SlayDigital.ai, we build simple, custom AI web agents that let people chat directly with your site's content. To show you what I mean, I set up a quick demo using your site:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_thingamabob_com

Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner to open the box, type a question, and the agent will answer based on your site’s info.

You (or your visitors) can try asking things like:
- What is Thingamabob all about?
- How do I see more #ThingamabobThursday posts?
- Is there a way to buy retro merchandise from the site?
- Where can I follow Thingamabob on social media?
- How do I submit my own throwback story or image?

If you’re curious how this could work on your real site (or have any questions), let me know—I’d be happy to chat.

Cheers,
