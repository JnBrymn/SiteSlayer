SUBJECT: Helping Patients Get Quick Answers at Dentistry of Nashville

Hi Lori,

I’ve been reading through Dentistry of Nashville’s website and really appreciate how you put empathy and clarity first for every patient. It’s clear your team does a great job welcoming new and returning families into the practice.

At SlayDigital.ai, we help practices like yours make it even easier for patients to get answers by adding a simple, custom AI chat agent directly to your website. It responds to common questions using only the information that’s already there—no jargon, just straightforward help for your visitors.

We put together a quick mock of your site with a working agent: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/dentistryofnashville_com. Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner and type in your question to see how it works.

You can try asking things like:
- What dental services do you offer?
- How does your same-day crown technology work?
- Who are your dentists, and what are their backgrounds?
- What are your office hours and location?
- How can I book an appointment?

I’d love to hear if this could help cut down on repetitive emails and make things easier for both your team and your patients. No pressure—just let me know if you’d like to learn more.

Warm regards,  
Zac
