SUBJECT: Helping Patients Get Answers Faster—See Your Site’s Demo Agent

Hi Dentistry of Nashville team,

I’m reaching out after seeing how you prioritize patient comfort and clear information—from advanced same-day crowns to your family-oriented approach in Nashville. At SlayDigital.ai, we help practices like yours turn patient questions into quick, helpful answers right on your website.

We’ve set up a simple demo of your own site here: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/dentistryofnashville_com. Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner to open a chat box—visitors can type questions, and the agent replies instantly using your current site’s information.

You can try asking things like:
- What insurance plans do you accept?
- How do I schedule a same-day crown appointment?
- Are you accepting new patients of all ages?
- What should I do if I have a dental emergency?
- How does your in-office savings plan work?

I’d be glad to show you how this could help your team reduce repetitive calls and guide patients with less back-and-forth. If you’re interested in a quick walkthrough or have questions, just let me know—no pressure.

Best,
Zac
