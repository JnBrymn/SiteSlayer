SUBJECT: Helping Your Patients Get Answers Faster at Dentistry of Nashville

Hello Dentistry of Nashville team,

I’m reaching out after visiting your website and seeing your long tradition of family-focused dental care in Nashville. The comfortable, personal experience you offer really stands out.

At SlayDigital.ai, we help practices like yours reduce repetitive questions and make it even easier for patients to get the information they need—without adding any tech hassle. We do this by creating simple AI chat agents that use the information already on your website to answer patient questions, right on your site.

To show what this could look like for you, we set up a demo here:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/dentistryofnashville_com

To try it, just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner. A chat box will open—type in a question, and the agent will respond, using your own site’s content.

You can try asking:  
• What dental insurance plans do you accept?  
• How does the same-day crown process work?  
• What are your office hours and location?  
• Who are your dentists and what are their backgrounds?  
• How do I schedule or change an appointment?

If making patient information more accessible sounds helpful, I’d be glad to answer questions or discuss further—no pressure.

Best,  
Zac Slay
