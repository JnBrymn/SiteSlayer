SUBJECT: A Simple Way to Help Your Patients Get Answers Instantly

-----------------------------------------

Hi Dentistry of Nashville Team,

I love how your practice blends tradition with leading-edge technology—making every patient feel at home while offering advanced dental solutions. I’m Zac, founder of SlayDigital.ai, and I build simple, custom AI chat agents that help patients find clear answers on your website, 24/7.

I’ve put together a quick demo using your own website content: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/dentistryofnashville_com. Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner, type any question in the box, and the agent will answer using info directly from your site.

You can try asking things like:
- What should I do if I have a dental emergency?
- Do you accept my insurance or offer an in-office savings plan?
- How does CEREC same-day crown technology work?
- What cosmetic dentistry options are available?
- Are clear aligners a good fit for adults?

This helps visitors get answers fast—reducing repetitive calls and making it even easier for new and returning patients to understand your offerings.

If this looks useful, I’d be happy to chat about making it live on your site or tailor it further for your team’s needs. No pressure—just let me know if you’re interested!

Warm regards,  
Zac
