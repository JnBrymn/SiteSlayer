Hi Lori,

I’ve enjoyed discovering how Dentistry of Nashville blends tradition with innovative dental care—especially your focus on comfort, advanced technology, and serving families across generations.

I wanted to share something practical that could make your team’s day a little easier while giving patients instant, friendly answers: At SlayDigital.ai, we create simple AI web agents tailored to your site’s own content. These agents help reduce repetitive questions, guide visitors, and keep your warm, personal touch—just online.

We’ve set up a quick demo using a mock of your website here: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/dentistryofnashville_com  
You’ll see a chat icon in the bottom-right. Click it to open the chat box—then just type in any question, and the agent will answer based on the info already on your site.

You can try asking things like:
- “What dental insurance plans do you accept?”
- “How does your CEREC same-day crown process work?”
- “Who are your dentists, and what are their specialties?”
- “What are your office hours and location?”
- “Do you offer clear aligners, and how do I get started?”

If you think something like this could help save your team a few emails or calls each week, I’d be happy to chat and answer questions. No pressure at all—just let me know if you’re interested.

Warmly,  
Zac
