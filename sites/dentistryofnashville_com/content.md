## Advanced Technology for Better Dentistry

At our practice, we go to great lengths to provide comfortable and effective dental care. To help achieve this, our team is equipped with some of the most innovative technology available in dentistry. Read on to learn about some of the technology we feature at Dentistry of Nashville.

![LANAP](https://dentistryofnashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/lanap-laser-surgery.jpg)

### LANAP Laser Treatment

For patients suffering from periodontal disease, we offer LANAP laser treatment as an alternative to conventional surgery. This treatment is accomplished using a variable pulsed laser, eliminating the need for incisions. Between its minimally invasive procedure and proven results, it’s no wonder that more and more patients with periodontal disease are choosing LANAP for treatment.

![Close-up of CEREC Milling Machine](https://dentistryofnashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CEREC-Milling-Machine-768x432.jpg)

### CEREC Same-Day Technology

The CEREC® system creates porcelain crowns and onlays that are customized to match the color and size of each patient’s teeth. This technology allows us to condense a process that used to take weeks or even months into just one simple office visit. With CEREC® same-day crowns, you won’t have to wait to show off your new smile.

### Intraoral Camera

Our intraoral cameras produce high-quality scans of your mouth, allowing you to see the results of your treatment in real time. With the use of these cameras, we can identify diseases such as oral cancer in their earliest stages, greatly reducing your risk of serious health problems.

![Dr. Elam examining Digital radiograph](https://dentistryofnashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/HI-RES-Dentistry-of-Nashville-7-7-17-58-768x432.jpg)

### Digital X-Rays

Digital x-rays have become an essential tool in dentistry because they allow us to identify potentially serious threats to your health while we still have time to treat them. Some of these threats that are virtually invisible without x-rays include cysts, tumors, and decay between your teeth. In addition to providing high-quality images in a short span of time, our digital x-rays expose patients to 90% less radiation than traditional ones.

![Example of 3D imaging](https://dentistryofnashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/3d-imaging-768x430.png)

### 3D Imaging

Our advanced 3D imaging makes certain procedures easier than ever before, especially when it comes to the dental implant process. With this technology, we can identify the location of your nerves, assess the density of your jawbone, and find the optimal spots for placing your implants.

The way your smile looks influences how often you smile and how confident you feel during social situations. At Dentistry of Nashville, our cosmetic dentist and team  help patients achieve a smile that they are proud to share. Our cosmetic dental services are tailored to help you feel good and smile easier. Whether your smile has become damaged or stained and you want to restore its aesthetic, or you just want to enhance your smile’s natural beauty, we have a cosmetic dentistry service that can help.

## Veneers

Dental veneers are thin pieces of tooth-like material that can be used to reshape your smile, fix damage, and make your teeth look brighter and straighter. Patients love [dental veneers](https://dentistryofnashville.com/about-us/before-after/) because they look completely natural and give patients control over the way their smile looks. Our dental veneer services are versatile and can be used to correct a number of defects and to enhance the way your smile looks. If you want a stunning, celebrity smile, veneers can help you achieve your smile goals.

## Teeth Whitening

Teeth whitening is one of the simplest ways to quickly improve the way your smile looks aside from [dental crowns](https://dentistryofnashville.com/our-services/crown-bridge-same-day-dentistry/). Over time, teeth can become stained or discolored. Some patients avoid smiling because they don’t like their tooth color. With our take-home trays, patients can enjoy brilliant white teeth and a treatment that can be administered at their own convenience.

## Tooth-Colored Fillings

Our fillings are made with a special composite that matches your natural teeth. With a tooth-colored filling, you can feel confident in the beauty of your smile, even after your tooth has become damaged. Tooth-colored fillings are one of the many ways we help you maintain a beautiful, healthy smile.

# Dental Implants

5. [Dental Implants](https://dentistryofnashville.com/our-services/dental-implants/)

## What is a dental implant?

Implants are a solution for missing teeth. When space is created by a missing tooth, it allows surrounding teeth to move, which may lead to further tooth loss. An implant is affixed to the jaw bone to mimic a tooth and tooth root, keeping the surrounding teeth in line, and restoring function.

## Ready for the best solution to missing teeth?

[Schedule Consultation](https://dentistryofnashville.com/contact-us/appointment-request/ "Request an Appointment")

[Call Now](tel:6153833690 "Request an Appointment")

## The Dental Implant Process

At our practice in Nashville, we’ll perform every step of the implant process in one convenient location. In some cases, Dr. Fleming will recommend one or more supplemental procedures to prepare the patient for the dental implant process.

### In most cases, the dental implant process will look like this:

#### Initial Consultation:

The first step towards your new smile is scheduling your initial consultation. One of our highly-qualified implant dentists, Dr. Fleming, or Dr. Lambrick, will perform a comprehensive oral health evaluation, checking your jawbone density and the state of your gum tissue to determine if you’re ready for dental implants. In some cases, supplemental procedures such as bone grafting or gum augmentation will be necessary to prepare the patient for implant surgery.

#### Dental Implant Placement:

The next step is for our dentist to place your dental implants. The procedure involves creating a small hole to insert the titanium implant fixture into the jawbone. We do everything we can to make the procedure as painless as possible, but sedation is available if you request it.

#### Adjustment Period

Following your surgery, it will require between 3 and 6 months for the implant to become integrated with your jawbone. This is a very important period in the dental implant process, so it’s vital for patients to keep the surgical site clean and free of irritation

#### Crown placement:

Once the implant fixture is fully acclimated to your smile, our implant dentist will place the abutment (a connecting piece that goes in the middle) and your attractive new prosthetic crown. Now you’ll be ready to face the world with confidence in your new smile.

# Periodontal Services

3. [Services](https://dentistryofnashville.com/our-services/)
5. [Periodontal Services](https://dentistryofnashville.com/our-services/periodontal-services/)

## What is Periodontal Disease?

Periodontal disease is gum disease. It is a silent, painless, chronic, and communicable bacterial infection that can go undetected until severe gum and bone destruction occur.

It is caused by bacterial plaque, which creates toxins that damage the gums. In the initial stages of the disease, gums can become red, swollen, and bleed easily. However, some patients have no symptoms at all. If the condition worsens, gums and bone that support the teeth can become seriously damaged. The teeth can become loose, fall out, or have to be removed.

## What is LANAP?

Laser periodontal therapy is different from traditional gum surgery that involves removing gum tissue with a scalpel and placing stitches. Instead, diseased tissue is removed with a special laser using an FDA cleared and patented procedure called LANAP, which stands for Laser Assisted New Attachment Procedure.

Dr. James Fleming is fully trained and licensed to perform Laser Periodontal Therapy using the LANAP procedure. The specific wavelength of the laser allows it to remove diseased tissue and leave the healthy gum tissue. The LANAP protocol is the only laser patented protocol to treat periodontal disease. LANAP is a regenerative procedure, which means that the patient does not lose tissue volume or attachment, and bone is regenerated. Furthermore, there is very little post-op sensitivity to LANAP compared to traditional periodontal surgery utilizing a scalpel.  
 LANAP itself consists of four simple steps that are much less traumatic to the teeth and gum line than traditional dental surgery, which helps the mouth heal much more quickly.

#### How does this benefit you?

There are many benefits of LANAP treatment compared to traditional methods. These include:

- Faster recovery time
- The height of the gums around the teeth is preserved as opposed to traditional surgery
- Less bleeding
- Feels almost no discomfort during or after the procedure
- Minor pain that can be managed by over-the-counter medication
