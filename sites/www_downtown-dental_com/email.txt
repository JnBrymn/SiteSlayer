-----------------------------------------

Hi Downtown Dental team,

I’m reaching out because your practice’s commitment to patient care and education really stands out—especially with your focus on advanced technology and making visits as smooth as possible for everyone in Chicago.

I’m Zac from SlayDigital.ai, and we build custom, easy-to-use AI chat agents for dental practices. These agents live right on your website and help patients quickly get answers to common questions using the information already on your site.

To show you what I mean, here’s a quick demo using a mock-up of your site: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_downtown-dental_com. Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner and ask a question—no learning curve needed.

You can try asking things like:
• Is the $79 new patient special still available, and what’s included?
• What dental insurance plans do you accept?
• How do I book an emergency appointment at either location?
• Where can I download new patient forms, and do you offer them in Spanish?
• What are the details on parking discounts for River North and Loop?

This type of agent can reduce repetitive phone calls and make it even easier for new or anxious patients to find what they need.

If you’d like to discuss whether something like this fits your workflow, just let me know—I’m happy to answer questions or set up a quick call.

Best regards,  
Zac
