SUBJECT: A Simple Way to Make Patient Questions Easier on Your Website

-----------------------------------------

Hi Downtown Dental Team,

I’m reaching out because your commitment to clear, comprehensive care really stands out—especially with your focus on making every visit comfortable and stress-free for patients in both the Loop and River North.

I'm Zac from SlayDigital.ai, and we build simple website chat agents powered by your own site’s content—helping visitors quickly get answers without searching or waiting for a callback.

To show you what this could look like for Downtown Dental, we put together a live demo using your site: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_downtown-dental_com. There’s a chat icon in the bottom-right corner—just click to open the chat box, then type a question. The agent replies using information already on your website.

You can try asking things like:
- “What’s included in the $79 new patient special?”
- “Which dental insurance plans do you accept?”
- “How do I book an emergency appointment?”
- “What teeth whitening options are available?”
- “Is discounted parking available for Loop or River North?”

Our custom agents help cut down on repetitive questions and make it easy for patients to find what they need—right when they’re ready to book.

If you’d like to see how this could work for Downtown Dental or have feedback on the demo, just let me know. No sales pitch—happy to answer questions or brainstorm how this could best fit your practice.

Best,
Zac Slay
