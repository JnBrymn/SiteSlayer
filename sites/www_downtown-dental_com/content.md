# Cosmetic Dentistry

### SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT


Would you like to feel confident with a beautiful smile? As a cosmetic dentist in Chicago, we offer a variety of cosmetic dentistry services to help you have a smile makeover and get the teeth you’ve always wanted, often in just one day!

## How We Can Help

At our Chicago practice, we prioritize your comfort and results. Our skilled cosmetic dentists will work closely with patients to determine which cosmetic procedure and cosmetic dentistry treatment options best enhance your smile. Whether you want to remedy a gap in your bite or hope to remove discoloration from the surface of your teeth, we have the technology and expertise to improve your teeth’s aesthetic appearance and functionality. Centered in the heart of Chicago, our office is dedicated to crafting beautiful smiles through advanced care and technology.
Here are some of the services we provide:

- Veneers – Custom-made for each individual patient, porcelain dental veneers are a painless and efficient way to transform your teeth. These devices are made from a thin shell of porcelain and are glued directly onto the surface of your natural teeth. Not only do porcelain veneers cover cosmetic issues such as crooked teeth, uneven teeth, misshapen teeth, cracks, chips, misalignment, and stained teeth or discoloration, but they also resolve structural insufficiencies, enhancing both aesthetics and function.
- Teeth Whitening – Teeth whitening procedures, a popular cosmetic dental procedure and a key aspect of general dentistry and dental care, are the most common cosmetic treatments. If you would like to remove years of stains and discoloration from the surface of your teeth, we have a number of cosmetic dentistry procedures and methods we can do! We provide in-office teeth whitening treatments, custom-made whitening trays for your personal use, and even our own brand of high-powered professional whitening strips. Your smile will look brighter than it ever has before!
- Dental Implants – While [dental implants in Chicago](https://www.downtown-dental.com/services/dental-implants/) certainly have a number of cosmetic benefits, you’ll find that they also improve the structure of your bite! Made from titanium, implants serve to replace severely decayed or missing teeth with a strong, permanent prosthetic. The dental implant fuses to the jawbone—so it is as strong and durable as a healthy natural tooth—and is covered with a custom-made dental crown to ensure it blends seamlessly with the rest of your smile!
- Bonding – If you have a chipped or broken tooth or would like to change the shape or size of your teeth, our restorative dentistry dental bonding treatment can help! Using a tooth-colored resin applied directly to the surface of your dental enamel, your dentist will be able to reshape your tooth to your exact desired specifications. With our expert cosmetic dental services, trusted dentists, and standard procedures, the damage to your tooth will disappear in just one appointment!
- Crowns – Acting as a cap that directly covers your existing tooth, crowns greatly improve the structure and appearance of decayed or damaged teeth. Through this cosmetic dental treatment, we’ll take a mold to design your custom crown and put it in place in about two to three weeks. When your custom-made crown is cemented into place, it blends perfectly with your smile to improve both appearance and function!

If you’d like to learn more about how Downtown Dental and our best general dentist and Chicago cosmetic dentist can improve your smile with cosmetic dental treatments, contact our [dental clinic in Chicago IL](https://www.downtown-dental.com/) today to schedule your consultation with the right cosmetic dentist!

## FAQs about Cosmetic Dentistry

### What’s the difference between a dentist and a cosmetic dentist?

A general dentist focuses on maintaining your oral health through preventive care, cleanings, and treating common dental issues like cavities or gum disease. A cosmetic dentist, on the other hand, specializes in improving the appearance of your teeth, gums, and smile. Common cosmetic dental procedures include teeth whitening, dental veneers, dental bonding, and dental crowns. If you’re looking for a cosmetic dentist in Chicago, Downtown Dental offers a variety of cosmetic dental services to enhance your smile. Visit our dental office to explore your cosmetic dental options.

### Is cosmetic dentistry good for my teeth?

Yes, cosmetic dentistry can improve both the look and function of your teeth. Many cosmetic dental procedures also provide restorative benefits. For example, dental implants not only replace missing teeth but also maintain jawbone health, while dental crowns protect a damaged tooth. At Downtown Dental, our Chicago cosmetic dentists ensure that every cosmetic dental treatment is designed to promote good oral health along with aesthetic improvements. Our experienced team is committed to providing high-quality cosmetic dentistry services to keep your smile healthy and beautiful.

### What is the difference between cosmetic and restorative dentistry?

While cosmetic dentistry focuses on improving the appearance of your smile through teeth whitening, dental veneers, and dental bonding, restorative dentistry aims to restore the functionality of your teeth. Restorative procedures like dental implants and dental crowns address missing teeth or damaged teeth to restore bite function and oral health. However, some procedures, such as dental crowns, can fall into both categories since they improve both appearance and functionality. Visit Downtown Dental to learn more about our comprehensive cosmetic dental care and restorative dentistry options.

### Why do you need cosmetic dentistry?

You might benefit from cosmetic dental care if you have crooked teeth, stained teeth, misaligned teeth, uneven teeth, or damaged teeth. These issues can affect both your appearance and self-confidence. Cosmetic dentistry treatments like dental veneers, teeth whitening, and dental bonding offer solutions to create a natural-looking smile. At Downtown Dental, we provide the best cosmetic dental services in Chicago to help you achieve a smile that makes you feel good. Schedule a consultation with our cosmetic dentists today to discuss your cosmetic dental options. This visit allows us to address your specific questions and develop a treatment plan that fits your needs.

### What’s better: veneers or implants?

Dental veneers and dental implants serve different purposes. Veneers are thin shells placed on the front surface of natural teeth to improve their appearance, making them ideal for stained teeth, crooked teeth, or damaged teeth. Dental implants are used to replace missing teeth and function as permanent solution for tooth loss. Both are effective cosmetic dental procedures depending on your needs. Consult with a cosmetic dentist in Chicago at Downtown Dental to determine the right option for you. Whether you need veneers or implants, we offer personalized cosmetic dental treatment to fit your goals.

### Do Chicago cosmetic dentists offer same-day teeth whitening?

Yes, many Chicago cosmetic dentists, including Downtown Dental, offer same-day teeth whitening services. This quick and effective cosmetic dental procedure can brighten your smile in just one visit. Whether you’re preparing for a special event or just want a fresher look, our cosmetic dental care team can provide professional teeth whitening that delivers noticeable results. Schedule an appointment today at our dental office to experience the benefits of cosmetic dentistry firsthand.

### What is the cost of cosmetic dentistry in Chicago?

The cost of cosmetic dental services varies based on the specific cosmetic dentistry procedure you choose. Factors such as the complexity of the treatment and the materials used will affect pricing. At Downtown Dental, we provide a range of cosmetic dental options from teeth whitening to dental veneers and dental implants, all tailored to meet your needs and budget. Our team will work with you to create a customized treatment plan. Contact our dental office to learn more about our affordable cosmetic dentistry services and schedule a consultation today.

## Your Best Smile Yet is Just One Visit Away!

Invisalign Chicago | Downtown Dental


# Invisalign


Do you want a straighter smile, but don’t want to have embarrassing metal brackets on your teeth? We have good news! You no longer need brackets and wires to align your teeth. At Downtown Dental, we offer an Invisalign treatment process to fix an array of orthodontic issues and give you the beautiful smile you’ve always wanted.

## Why Our Patients Love Invisalign

Using a series of custom-made, Invisalign aligner trays, the Invisalign system gradually shifts your teeth into place without the pain of metal braces. This innovative orthodontic treatment has already successfully helped over four million Invisalign patients. So why do so many people love Invisalign clear aligners? Here are a few of our favorite things about this treatment:

- It is invisible. This system is great for both teens and adults because Invisalign is virtually invisible. These Invisaalign clear aligners eliminate the need for bulky metal brackets on your teeth, so you can straighten your smile discretely.
- You can remove your aligners at any time. Eating, brushing your teeth, and flossing are so much easier with the Invisalign system. You can take your aligner trays out whenever necessary, making them much more comfortable and convenient.
- It is more efficient than most other orthodontic methods. Straightening your teeth with Invisalign is actually 50 percent quicker than other systems. When used correctly, patients begin to notice changes in their smile within a matter of weeks.
- It is highly convenient. Using the Invisalign system is incredibly easy. You’ll have your new clear aligner trays delivered directly to your door every two weeks, and your Invisalign dentist will only need to check in on your progress every four to six weeks at our Chicago office.
- It is comfortable. Without the need for metal braces and wires, Invisalign is actually much more comfortable than braces—and safer! No metal device on your teeth means you won’t need to worry about cutting your lips or cheeks while wearing them.

### How We Can Help

The Invisalign process is quicker and simpler than you might think. Here are a few steps you can take to a straighter, perfect smile:

- Schedule your initial consultation. In order to begin the Invisalign treatment process, your dentist at Downtown Dental in Chicago IL will do an examination to determine whether or not clear removable aligners are right for you. Invisalign in Chicago can treat a wide array of orthodontic issues— including overcrowding, malformed bites, gaps, misalignment, and more— so if you’re in generally good health and free of gum disease, it is probable that this system will be beneficial to you.
- Get fitted for your custom aligners. Your Invisalign trays are made specifically for your teeth, so there are a few steps your dentist will need to take for these custom-made trays to be manufactured. This includes taking dental impressions of your mouth, x-rays, photographs, and making a record of your bite to ensure your clear aligner trays fit perfectly. This is a crucial step in the Invisalign process, as it ensures the best possible results.
- Follow your Invisalign treatment plan. With clear braces, you will receive a new set of invisible custom aligners every two weeks to accommodate aligner changes and gradually move your teeth into place. Be certain to wear your clear removable aligners for at least 20-22 hours every day, and only really take them out for eating, brushing, and flossing if possible. You will set up appointments with your dentist at Downtown Dental in Chicago IL every six weeks, which will allow us to track your progress. By following your dentist’s instructions for use and maintenance, you’ll begin seeing results in no time!
- Enjoy your results. You’ll love your newly straightened perfect smile. After your treatment is complete, your dentist will work with you to create a custom-made retainer. This will allow you to enjoy the results for the rest of your life!

Gum Disease Treatment Chicago, IL | Downtown Dental


# Gum Disease Treatment


With routine gum health and general dentistry check-ups at the dentist, gum disease can be easily prevented. However, an estimated 75 percent of Americans over 35 years old have some form of the disease, which can ultimately cause advanced gum disease and severe health issues like stroke, respiratory illness, heart disease and more if left untreated. At Downtown Dental, we’re committed to helping you prevent and treat this largely avoidable illness to ensure you maintain healthy gums and good oral health for years to come, by offering one of the best gum disease treatment Chicago has to offer.


Gum disease begins with gingivitis—an infection caused bacteria found in plaque. If it is left untreated, this can progress to advanced gum disease that exhibits a number of painful symptoms, including receding gums, tooth loss, and more. Our in-house periodontist provides a number of periodontal disease treatment options which vary depending on the condition of your gums. With these treatment option, we can skillfully and thoroughly treat your periodontal issues:

- Biopsy – A dental care method used to diagnose oral cancer involving the examination of a tissue sample.
- Bone Grafting – The building up of the jaw bone, used to support restorative devices such as [dental implants](https://www.downtown-dental.com/services/dental-implants/) and other periodontal procedures.
- Canine Exposure – A procedure to uncover impacted teeth (usually wisdom or canine teeth) that has become stuck in the surrounding gum tissue or bone.
- Crown Lengthening – A procedure to reshape gum tissue and bone shape to expose more of the enamel of the teeth for restorative and/or cosmetic purposes.
- Arestin – An antibiotic ointment used to treat infected gum pockets after scaling and root planing procedures.
- Frenectomy – A minor procedure to remedy a frenulum (or connective tissue between the gums and lip) that is too short or thick.
- Gum Grafting – A procedure to supplement the gums using tissue from the palate or a donor.
- Occlusal Adjustment – Corrects a bite misalignment as a result of crowding, shifting, or missing teeth.
- Periodontal Splinting – Joining teeth together to strengthen them when the surrounding gum tissue becomes loose.
- Osseous Grafting – A surgery which removes defects from the bone tissue around the teeth, serving as a treatment for periodontitis.
- Cosmetic Periodontal Surgery – Used to improve the appearance of your gums by removing excess tissue.
- Scaling and Root Planing – Non-surgical dental cleanings in which plaque and tartar is removed from below the gum line and deep in the dental pocket.
- Osseous Surgery – A periodontal disease treatment to remedy enlarged gum pocket and remove decayed gum tissue as a result of periodontal disease.

While gum disease is asymptomatic in its earliest stages, there are a number of risk factors for periodontitis to be aware of in order to catch this illness before it can really take hold. If you suffer from chronic stress, bruxism, diabetes, or have a genetic predisposition to the disease, you may be at higher risk. Also, smoking, certain medications, poor nutrition, and poor oral hygiene can increase the likelihood of getting gum disease. If you meet any of these criteria, be certain to schedule your routine dental care check-up right away to take the necessary preventative measures.

Endodontic Treatment - Chicago, IL | Downtown Dental


# Root Canals & Extractions


If you have a severely decayed, infected tooth, or damaged tooth, it is possible that you may need a root canal therapy or extraction to remedy the issue. With innovative technology and skilled professional Endodontists at Downtown Dental in Chicago, IL, we can perform these crucial procedures to give you long-term relief with little to no pain.

## Root Canals

Root canal therapy is an integral part of endodontic treatment that helps preserve your natural teeth. A root canal treatment is used as a last resort procedure aimed to save a natural tooth when its innermost layer suffers from inflammation, infection, or damage. Within your tooth, there is a substance known as “pulp.” This soft tissue connects the outer layer of your tooth (or enamel) all the way to the root. Because your adult teeth do not need the tooth pulp to sustain oral health, there are times when the best option is to remove infected pulp entirely in order to salvage the tooth. When having a root canal procedure, here are a few steps you can expect to take:

1. First, we will take X-rays of your tooth to help determine the need for root canal treatment. This will allow us to see the extent of the damage and determine if an abscess has occurred.
2. We will use a local anesthetic to numb the area of the root canal treatment. Because of this, you won’t experience any pain during the procedure!
3. Using a rubber dam, we will block off outside moisture from the point of the procedure.
4. We will then make a small opening in the tooth using a drill to access the innermost layer of the tooth.
5. We will then remove bacteria, debris, and infected pulp from within the tooth, and then insert an anti-bacterial medication to eliminate the infection and support healing.
6. When the pulp has been removed, we will put a temporary filling in place while the site heals, which will be filled at a later time with a permanent filling.
7. Once the tooth is healed, we will place a dental crown that is customized to you, so you won’t even be able to notice it is there!

Many people experience immediate pain relief after the root canal procedure, as the source of the infection has been removed. This type of endodontic care is essential to prevent further damage and ensure a clean and healthy recovery. When the procedure is complete, we will provide you with instructions to ensure your tooth is allowed to heal properly—this basically includes a thorough dental hygiene routine, avoiding the use of the tooth, regular check-ups, and over-the-counter pain medication if needed. Once the tooth has healed, you can expect the results of your surgery to last a lifetime!

## Tooth Extractions

Extractions are another very common form of oral surgery. This can treat a number of issues—from impacted teeth to overcrowding, to severely damaged or decayed teeth. This dental procedure is also common with wisdom teeth. After carefully monitoring your wisdom teeth, your dentist may decide to extract them as they otherwise often cause many issues with the surrounding teeth. For personalized dental care, our experienced Endodontists in Chicago offer a comfortable extraction experience. When having a natural tooth extracted, there are a few things you can typically expect from the procedure:

1. First, your dentist will take x-rays to look at all of your teeth and determine if tooth extraction is the best available option.
2. Then, your dentist will administer an anesthetic to numb the area. The strength or type of anesthetic may vary, depending on the location of the tooth that requires extraction.
3. In a simple tooth extraction (when the tooth is visible), a dentist will loosen the necessary tooth with a device called an elevator, and then use forceps to extract the tooth.
4. When the tooth being extracted is still hidden within the gums, an oral surgeon will need to make an incision in the gums. Then, they will either need to remove some of the bone that surrounds the tooth or cut the tooth in half to extract it.

Depending on the depth and location of the affected tooth within your gums, the pain you experience after the surgery may vary. Typically, though, the post-operative pain is mild and can be easily treated with over-the-counter pain medication.
If you’d like to schedule a free consultation or know more about the cost of root canal treatment or dental extraction or if you have more questions about what the treatment entails, talk to an [oral surgeon in downtown Chicago](https://www.downtown-dental.com/services/oral-surgery/) and call our office today!

Dental Whitening Chicago IL | Downtown Dental


# Teeth Whitening


Professional Teeth whitening is one of our most popular cosmetic dentistry procedures, and with good reason! We offer a variety of teeth whitening treatment methods to cater to your individual needs—from in-house treatments to our own brand of professional whitening strips. Even tough stains from coffee, tobacco, wine, and more will disappear. Your teeth will be multiple shades whiter after just one teeth whitening procedure!


At Downtown Dental, we offer three separate teeth whitening services to give you the whitening power you need in the method that suits you best. Here are a few dental tooth professional teeth whitening treatments and tooth bleaching treatments you may choose to consider:

- In-Office Teeth Whitening Treatment – This pain-free whitening process gives you noticeably whiter teeth with just one visit to the dentist. First, your dentist will remove the debris, plaque, and tartar from the surface of your teeth, and then place a whitening agent directly onto your natural tooth enamel. Then, we will use a laser or heat lamp to activate the whitening gel or bleaching gel, giving you noticeable results almost immediately. You can expect to be able to enjoy your new sparkling smile for the next few months!
- Custom-Made, Take-Home Trays – Now, you can apply a professional teeth whitening treatment in the comfort of your own home. We’ll simply take an impression of your teeth to form custom whitening trays that fit perfectly to your bite. This allows the whitening gel to target each of your teeth to give you spectacular results.

- Take-home Whitening Kits – We offer take-home trays so that you can brighten your smile in the comfort of your home.

### How to Keep Your Teeth Sparkling White

We know how difficult it can be to keep your natural teeth pearly white, even with a diligent oral healthcare routine. If you just had your teeth whitening procedure done, here are a few steps you can take to ensure your professional teeth whitening treatments lasts for as long as possible!

- Maintain a good oral hygiene routine. By brushing your teeth twice per day and after meals, as well as flossing at least once a day, you can remove the food particles that would otherwise stain your teeth and lead to decay and tooth discoloration.
- Quit smoking. Due to the tar and nicotine in cigarettes, smoking can leave a yellowish and blackish stain on your teeth that is hard to remove. By quitting, you can avoid these stains as well as other harmful effects on your oral health.
- Avoid coffee and other known stain-causing foods/beverages. There are a number of foods to look out for if you want to keep your teeth sparkling white. Coffee, tea, and sugary drinks like soda are particularly harmful to your smile’s appearance. You may also want to look out for acidic foods like citrus fruits, curry, tomato sauce, soy sauce, etc. as this can wear down your tooth enamel and lead to a yellowing effect on your teeth.
- Schedule regular teeth cleaning and dental check-ups. A healthy smile is a beautiful smile! By visiting the dental office at least twice a year, you can prevent harmful oral health issues such as gingivitis, tooth sensitivity,  and tooth decay, plus receive a professional cleaning to brighten your smile and improve your health!
