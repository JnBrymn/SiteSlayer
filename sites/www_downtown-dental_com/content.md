Professional Teeth Cleaning Chicago | Downtown Dental


# Professional Cleanings

### SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT


The American Dental Association recommends that you visit the dentist every six months for a routine dental cleaning and dental check-up. At Downtown Dental, your visit will include a thorough dental exam, x-rays, and high-tech professional teeth cleaning to improve your dental health, prevent disease, and enhance the appearance of your smile.

## How We Can Help

By using the latest in dental technology, we can ensure your professional dental cleaning will be efficient and pain-free. After reviewing your x-rays and dental records, your Chicago dentist will do a thorough dental exam of your oral cavity to uncover any areas of weakness, decay, inflammation, or infection in the teeth and gums. We will also screen for oral cancer, gum disease, and other dental issues. When your examination is complete, we will proceed with the following steps to provide you with a thorough professional teeth cleaning:

1. Removing Plaque and Tartar – Using a tool called a scaler, your dental hygienist will remove harmful dental plaque and tartar from between the teeth and along your gum line. This method will allow us to clean off tartar that cannot be removed through normal brushing and flossing.
2. High-Powered Brushing – Your dental hygienist will then utilize a high-powered electrical toothbrush and gritty toothpaste for dental deep cleaning and polishing on each individual tooth, removing any remaining stains and tartar that could wreak havoc on your oral hygiene over time.
3. Expert Flossing – Removing dental plaque and food debris from between the teeth is critical for preventing decay and gingivitis. A professional flossing will remove particles from between the teeth that even the most avid flossers may have missed.
4. Fluoride Treatment – To protect your teeth from decay and sustain the benefits of your routine dental cleaning for several months, your dental hygienist may provide a fluoride treatment. You will simply need to bite on a tray filled with a foam-like substance for one minute to receive the numerous benefits of this treatment.

### Why You Should Schedule a Cleaning Every Six Months

While a dental visit for professional cleaning only takes 30 minutes to an hour, the benefits of this preventative treatment are long-lasting. If you’re looking for a little extra incentive to schedule your biannual regular dental exams and cleaning, consider the following reasons to book today:

- Improve your overall health. Your oral health and your overall well-being are intrinsically linked. For example, gum disease can lead to severe issues like heart disease, respiratory illness, and premature birth. Halitosis (or bad breath) can be symptomatic of stomach issues. By scheduling your regular dental cleaning, you can prevent and diagnose dental problems and health issues before they begin.
- Prevent disease. Gum disease is caused by plaque and bacteria hidden on your teeth. By scheduling regular dental cleanings, you can prevent plaque from building up and causing gingivitis, an infection of the gums that leads to gum disease.
- Eliminate tartar buildup. When plaque has been left on your teeth for too long, it turns into a dark-tinted deposit on your teeth known as tartar. Unfortunately, tartar cannot be brushed away with a toothbrush, but must be removed by a dental professional during your cleaning.
- Fight tooth decay. Over time, the harmful acids released by plaque can lead to a dental cavity and tooth decay. If left untreated, this decay can become both painful and costly, even requiring root canal procedures and crowns in severe cases. Professional cleanings will allow you to eliminate this plaque before it can become problematic.
- Save money. Regular cleanings allow you to prevent having to receive costly restorative procedures like gum disease treatments, root canals, and more. A pain-free preventative cleaning can save you a lot of money in the long-run!
- Enhance your smile. A healthy smile is a beautiful smile. Teeth cleaning services will remove harmful tartar and unpleasant stains to give you a smile you can be proud of!

Cosmetic Dentist Chicago IL | Downtown Dental


# Cosmetic Dentistry


Would you like to feel confident with a beautiful smile? As a cosmetic dentist in Chicago, we offer a variety of cosmetic dentistry services to help you have a smile makeover and get the teeth you’ve always wanted, often in just one day!


At our Chicago practice, we prioritize your comfort and results. Our skilled cosmetic dentists will work closely with patients to determine which cosmetic procedure and cosmetic dentistry treatment options best enhance your smile. Whether you want to remedy a gap in your bite or hope to remove discoloration from the surface of your teeth, we have the technology and expertise to improve your teeth’s aesthetic appearance and functionality. Centered in the heart of Chicago, our office is dedicated to crafting beautiful smiles through advanced care and technology.
Here are some of the services we provide:

- Veneers – Custom-made for each individual patient, porcelain dental veneers are a painless and efficient way to transform your teeth. These devices are made from a thin shell of porcelain and are glued directly onto the surface of your natural teeth. Not only do porcelain veneers cover cosmetic issues such as crooked teeth, uneven teeth, misshapen teeth, cracks, chips, misalignment, and stained teeth or discoloration, but they also resolve structural insufficiencies, enhancing both aesthetics and function.
- Teeth Whitening – Teeth whitening procedures, a popular cosmetic dental procedure and a key aspect of general dentistry and dental care, are the most common cosmetic treatments. If you would like to remove years of stains and discoloration from the surface of your teeth, we have a number of cosmetic dentistry procedures and methods we can do! We provide in-office teeth whitening treatments, custom-made whitening trays for your personal use, and even our own brand of high-powered professional whitening strips. Your smile will look brighter than it ever has before!
- Dental Implants – While [dental implants in Chicago](https://www.downtown-dental.com/services/dental-implants/) certainly have a number of cosmetic benefits, you’ll find that they also improve the structure of your bite! Made from titanium, implants serve to replace severely decayed or missing teeth with a strong, permanent prosthetic. The dental implant fuses to the jawbone—so it is as strong and durable as a healthy natural tooth—and is covered with a custom-made dental crown to ensure it blends seamlessly with the rest of your smile!
- Bonding – If you have a chipped or broken tooth or would like to change the shape or size of your teeth, our restorative dentistry dental bonding treatment can help! Using a tooth-colored resin applied directly to the surface of your dental enamel, your dentist will be able to reshape your tooth to your exact desired specifications. With our expert cosmetic dental services, trusted dentists, and standard procedures, the damage to your tooth will disappear in just one appointment!
- Crowns – Acting as a cap that directly covers your existing tooth, crowns greatly improve the structure and appearance of decayed or damaged teeth. Through this cosmetic dental treatment, we’ll take a mold to design your custom crown and put it in place in about two to three weeks. When your custom-made crown is cemented into place, it blends perfectly with your smile to improve both appearance and function!

If you’d like to learn more about how Downtown Dental and our best general dentist and Chicago cosmetic dentist can improve your smile with cosmetic dental treatments, contact our [dental clinic in Chicago IL](https://www.downtown-dental.com/) today to schedule your consultation with the right cosmetic dentist!

## FAQs about Cosmetic Dentistry

### What’s the difference between a dentist and a cosmetic dentist?

A general dentist focuses on maintaining your oral health through preventive care, cleanings, and treating common dental issues like cavities or gum disease. A cosmetic dentist, on the other hand, specializes in improving the appearance of your teeth, gums, and smile. Common cosmetic dental procedures include teeth whitening, dental veneers, dental bonding, and dental crowns. If you’re looking for a cosmetic dentist in Chicago, Downtown Dental offers a variety of cosmetic dental services to enhance your smile. Visit our dental office to explore your cosmetic dental options.

### Is cosmetic dentistry good for my teeth?

Yes, cosmetic dentistry can improve both the look and function of your teeth. Many cosmetic dental procedures also provide restorative benefits. For example, dental implants not only replace missing teeth but also maintain jawbone health, while dental crowns protect a damaged tooth. At Downtown Dental, our Chicago cosmetic dentists ensure that every cosmetic dental treatment is designed to promote good oral health along with aesthetic improvements. Our experienced team is committed to providing high-quality cosmetic dentistry services to keep your smile healthy and beautiful.

### What is the difference between cosmetic and restorative dentistry?

While cosmetic dentistry focuses on improving the appearance of your smile through teeth whitening, dental veneers, and dental bonding, restorative dentistry aims to restore the functionality of your teeth. Restorative procedures like dental implants and dental crowns address missing teeth or damaged teeth to restore bite function and oral health. However, some procedures, such as dental crowns, can fall into both categories since they improve both appearance and functionality. Visit Downtown Dental to learn more about our comprehensive cosmetic dental care and restorative dentistry options.

### Why do you need cosmetic dentistry?

You might benefit from cosmetic dental care if you have crooked teeth, stained teeth, misaligned teeth, uneven teeth, or damaged teeth. These issues can affect both your appearance and self-confidence. Cosmetic dentistry treatments like dental veneers, teeth whitening, and dental bonding offer solutions to create a natural-looking smile. At Downtown Dental, we provide the best cosmetic dental services in Chicago to help you achieve a smile that makes you feel good. Schedule a consultation with our cosmetic dentists today to discuss your cosmetic dental options. This visit allows us to address your specific questions and develop a treatment plan that fits your needs.

### What’s better: veneers or implants?

Dental veneers and dental implants serve different purposes. Veneers are thin shells placed on the front surface of natural teeth to improve their appearance, making them ideal for stained teeth, crooked teeth, or damaged teeth. Dental implants are used to replace missing teeth and function as permanent solution for tooth loss. Both are effective cosmetic dental procedures depending on your needs. Consult with a cosmetic dentist in Chicago at Downtown Dental to determine the right option for you. Whether you need veneers or implants, we offer personalized cosmetic dental treatment to fit your goals.

### Do Chicago cosmetic dentists offer same-day teeth whitening?

Yes, many Chicago cosmetic dentists, including Downtown Dental, offer same-day teeth whitening services. This quick and effective cosmetic dental procedure can brighten your smile in just one visit. Whether you’re preparing for a special event or just want a fresher look, our cosmetic dental care team can provide professional teeth whitening that delivers noticeable results. Schedule an appointment today at our dental office to experience the benefits of cosmetic dentistry firsthand.

### What is the cost of cosmetic dentistry in Chicago?

The cost of cosmetic dental services varies based on the specific cosmetic dentistry procedure you choose. Factors such as the complexity of the treatment and the materials used will affect pricing. At Downtown Dental, we provide a range of cosmetic dental options from teeth whitening to dental veneers and dental implants, all tailored to meet your needs and budget. Our team will work with you to create a customized treatment plan. Contact our dental office to learn more about our affordable cosmetic dentistry services and schedule a consultation today.

Dental Implants in Chicago, IL | Downtown Dental


# Dental Implants


If you have severely damaged or decayed teeth or missing teeth, you don’t need to get partial tooth replacement or a denture to restore your smile. Now, with the titanium dental implant, you can permanently replace your damaged tooth with a device that feels and looks completely natural.


A dental implant surgery is a highly effective treatment for those suffering from severe tooth decay or damage on one or multiple teeth. Before beginning the dental implant process, there are a few factors you and your dentist will need to discuss to determine if dental implants are right for you. It is important that you are in good health before beginning treatment, and you should discuss any chronic illnesses—such as leukemia and diabetes—with your dentist beforehand. It is highly recommended that you do not use tobacco products when going through this treatment as it can impede your healing process. Finally, if your jaw structure is not strong enough to support the device, you may require additional surgeries in advance of receiving the tooth implant.
Once you have been cleared for the procedure, your implant dentist will first perform tooth extraction, and replace it with a titanium screw that will be inserted directly into the gums. As this heals, the screw will gradually fuse with your jawbone, making it feel as sturdy as healthy natural teeth. Your implant dentist will then place a customized porcelain crown over the screw. This will allow it to blend seamlessly with the neighboring teeth or adjacent teeth—no one will ever even notice that you have an artificial tooth! The entire dental implant surgery and treatment process takes anywhere from 6-12 weeks to complete. You may experience mild soreness, which can be managed with over-the-counter pain medication.

## Why Dental Implants?

There are a number of reasons why our patients love their affordable dental implants. Should you receive this treatment, you can expect to enjoy the following functional, restorative, and aesthetic improvements to your smile:

- Restored Functionality – Decayed and damaged teeth can have a profound effect on your speech, chewing mechanisms, and bite alignment. By replacing these teeth with dental implants and restoring the structure of your teeth, you will also benefit from the functional mechanisms of your mouth.
- Improved Appearance – By replacing a damaged tooth with a tooth implant, you can completely renew your smile. Covered with a customized crown, dental implants blend in flawlessly with the rest of your smile. As a tooth replacement, it will look and feel completely natural!
- Long-Lasting Results – Dental implants do not require any special dental care in order to last you a lifetime. These devices boast a 98 percent success rate—simply maintain a proper dental hygiene routine and they will stay firmly in place forever!

Overall, dental implants in Chicago will greatly improve your quality of life. With these devices, you’ll never have to worry about biting into certain foods or the appearance of your smile. They look and feel great—and you will too!

## Why Choose Dental Implants for Dental Reconstruction?

Dental implants are the ultimate solution for addressing a missing tooth or multiple teeth, offering a seamless blend of cosmetic dentistry and [oral surgery](https://www.downtown-dental.com/services/oral-surgery/). These titanium wonders integrate flawlessly with a dental crown, replicating the appearance and function of real natural teeth. What sets them apart is their ability to preserve the structure of the neighboring teeth, promote long-term oral health, and provide durability for years to come. Beyond aesthetics, dental implants improve biting and chewing, preventing bone loss, and maintaining overall oral health. They stand as the ideal choice for replacing missing teeth, offering a confident smile and functional benefits that traditional options simply can’t match.

## Why prioritize early implant placement?

Timely implant placement is crucial when considering a replacement tooth, as it helps preserve natural tooth alignment, prevents bone loss, ensures seamless integration of the replacement tooth for optimal aesthetics and function, and enhances oral hygiene by closing gaps that can trap debris and bacteria. Acting promptly not only safeguards your oral health but also leads to a more aesthetically pleasing and functional smile that closely resembles a natural tooth.

## Is my jawbone sufficient for dental implant placement?

Ensuring you have enough bone to support new dental implants is vital for their success. The strength and durability of dental implants depend on their integration with the jawbone. If you’re concerned about bone volume, a thorough examination, including dental imaging, can assess your jawbone’s dimensions and health. Insufficient bone can be addressed through bone grafting, mini dental implants, All-on-4 or All-on-6 techniques, or zygomatic implants, depending on the severity of bone loss.
Consulting a qualified dentist or oral surgeon is essential to determine the most suitable solution, ensuring your dental implant procedure results in a beautiful, functional smile that enhances your overall oral health.
If you would like to learn more about how dental implants in Chicago could be of benefit to you, or experience one of the best [cosmetic dentistry in Chicago](https://www.downtown-dental.com/services/cosmetic-dentistry/), simply call Downtown Dental today to set up a general dentistry consultation or learn more about our dental services.

Dental Whitening Chicago IL | Downtown Dental


# Teeth Whitening


Professional Teeth whitening is one of our most popular cosmetic dentistry procedures, and with good reason! We offer a variety of teeth whitening treatment methods to cater to your individual needs—from in-house treatments to our own brand of professional whitening strips. Even tough stains from coffee, tobacco, wine, and more will disappear. Your teeth will be multiple shades whiter after just one teeth whitening procedure!


At Downtown Dental, we offer three separate teeth whitening services to give you the whitening power you need in the method that suits you best. Here are a few dental tooth professional teeth whitening treatments and tooth bleaching treatments you may choose to consider:

- In-Office Teeth Whitening Treatment – This pain-free whitening process gives you noticeably whiter teeth with just one visit to the dentist. First, your dentist will remove the debris, plaque, and tartar from the surface of your teeth, and then place a whitening agent directly onto your natural tooth enamel. Then, we will use a laser or heat lamp to activate the whitening gel or bleaching gel, giving you noticeable results almost immediately. You can expect to be able to enjoy your new sparkling smile for the next few months!
- Custom-Made, Take-Home Trays – Now, you can apply a professional teeth whitening treatment in the comfort of your own home. We’ll simply take an impression of your teeth to form custom whitening trays that fit perfectly to your bite. This allows the whitening gel to target each of your teeth to give you spectacular results.

- Take-home Whitening Kits – We offer take-home trays so that you can brighten your smile in the comfort of your home.

### How to Keep Your Teeth Sparkling White

We know how difficult it can be to keep your natural teeth pearly white, even with a diligent oral healthcare routine. If you just had your teeth whitening procedure done, here are a few steps you can take to ensure your professional teeth whitening treatments lasts for as long as possible!

- Maintain a good oral hygiene routine. By brushing your teeth twice per day and after meals, as well as flossing at least once a day, you can remove the food particles that would otherwise stain your teeth and lead to decay and tooth discoloration.
- Quit smoking. Due to the tar and nicotine in cigarettes, smoking can leave a yellowish and blackish stain on your teeth that is hard to remove. By quitting, you can avoid these stains as well as other harmful effects on your oral health.
- Avoid coffee and other known stain-causing foods/beverages. There are a number of foods to look out for if you want to keep your teeth sparkling white. Coffee, tea, and sugary drinks like soda are particularly harmful to your smile’s appearance. You may also want to look out for acidic foods like citrus fruits, curry, tomato sauce, soy sauce, etc. as this can wear down your tooth enamel and lead to a yellowing effect on your teeth.
- Schedule regular teeth cleaning and dental check-ups. A healthy smile is a beautiful smile! By visiting the dental office at least twice a year, you can prevent harmful oral health issues such as gingivitis, tooth sensitivity,  and tooth decay, plus receive a professional cleaning to brighten your smile and improve your health!

To schedule your appointment for a professional whitening treatment from one of the best [cosmetic dentistry in Chicago](https://www.downtown-dental.com/services/cosmetic-dentistry/), contact Downtown Dental today! You may also visit our River North or [Loop dentist](https://www.downtown-dental.com/locations/loop/), depending on your location of convenience.
