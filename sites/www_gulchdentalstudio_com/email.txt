SUBJECT: An easy way to make answers seamless for your Gulch Dental Studio patients

-----------------------------------------

Hi Dr. Newman,

I’m continually impressed by how Gulch Dental Studio pairs modern technology with a truly personal, patient-first approach. Your team’s focus on comfort, education, and clear communication is obvious on every page.

I wanted to share something practical that could further enhance the patient experience you already excel at. At SlayDigital.ai, we help dental practices like yours by building simple, custom AI chat agents that sit quietly in the corner of your website. They allow patients to ask questions and get clear, direct answers based on your own content—no tech jargon, just real help.

To show how it works, I created a quick demo for your site:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_gulchdentalstudio_com  
Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner to open the box and try any patient question. The agent replies instantly using information from your own website.

You can try asking things like:
- What insurance do you accept, and can I use CareCredit for cosmetic treatment?
- How does your sedation dentistry work for anxious patients?
- What’s the process and cost for veneers?
- Is Invisalign right for me, and do you have an orthodontic specialist?
- How do I schedule a new patient appointment or download forms?

If you think this could save your team time or make things easier for your patients, I’d love to hear your thoughts. No pressure—just wanted to share a resource that might fit your already-excellent practice.

All the best,  
Zac Slay
