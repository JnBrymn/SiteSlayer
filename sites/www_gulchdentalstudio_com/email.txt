SUBJECT: Helping New Patients Get Answers Faster at Gulch Dental Studio

Hi there,

I’m reaching out because I was genuinely impressed by your focus on patient comfort and modern dental care at Gulch Dental Studio. Your commitment to clear communication and comprehensive services truly stands out.

I run SlayDigital.ai, where we build simple, custom AI web agents that let site visitors chat directly with your website and get instant answers—using only the info you already provide. This means fewer repetitive inquiries for your staff and a smoother experience for your patients.

I put together a quick demo using your own content here: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_gulchdentalstudio_com  
Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner and type a question—the agent will respond using details from your site.

You can try asking things like:
- “What types of sedation do you offer for anxious patients?”
- “Are you in-network with my dental insurance?”
- “How does Invisalign treatment work at your office?”
- “What’s the process for scheduling a new patient appointment?”
- “Can I see examples of smile makeovers you’ve done?”

If you’d like to explore if an agent like this could help your team and patients, I’d be happy to chat.  
No pressure—just let me know if you’re curious.

Best,  
Zac Slay
