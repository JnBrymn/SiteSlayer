Hi Dr. Newman,

I’ve spent some time exploring Gulch Dental Studio’s website, and I’m impressed by your patient-first approach and the care you dedicate to both comfort and clear communication.

I’m Zac, founder of SlayDigital.ai. We build simple web chat agents that let your visitors ask questions and instantly get answers based on the info you already provide online—helping your team save time and ensuring patients always feel heard.

I put together a quick demo using your own site so you can see how this works: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/www_gulchdentalstudio_com. Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner to open the box—then type a question, and you’ll get an answer right from your site’s content.

You can try asking things like:
- Do you offer same-day crowns?
- How does CareCredit financing work for cosmetic procedures?
- What types of sedation are available for nervous patients?
- Who do I contact for dental emergencies?
- How do I schedule a smile makeover consultation?

This can help patients find the right info right away, reduce repetitive calls, and make the process of choosing Gulch Dental Studio even smoother.

If it’s interesting, let me know and I’d be happy to chat through how you could tailor this to your workflow.

Wishing you and your team continued success,
Zac
