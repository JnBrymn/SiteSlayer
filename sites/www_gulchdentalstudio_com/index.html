<h2>
Porcelain Veneers
</h2>
<p>Stained, chipped, worn, or slightly crooked teeth affect not only your smile but also your confidence. The highly skilled dentists at Gulch Dental Studio can enhance your smile with ultra-thin dental veneers. We craft our custom <a href="https://www.gulchdentalstudio.com/services/veneers/">veneers in Nashville, TN,</a> with the finest materials, including IPS e.max® and IPS Empress®, which mimic the properties of natural enamel. This allows us to blend your new veneers with surrounding teeth for a seamless result. With the proper care, the highly advanced and exceptionally strong materials we use for our veneers can last over a decade. </p>










<h2>
Dental Crowns
</h2>
<p>If you suffer from broken, chipped, or missing teeth, our dentists can restore the appearance and function of your smile with our metal-free cosmetic crowns. A dental cap covers the visible portion of a tooth to reinforce and preserve its structure, restoring a damaged tooth to its normal function. We exclusively use the highest quality materials such as IPS e.max and IPS Empress for our <a href="https://www.gulchdentalstudio.com/services/dental-crowns/">dental crowns in Nashville, TN,</a> to closely match the natural shade of your smile.

<p>If you feel self-conscious about signs of aging surrounding your smile, we can help. Our dentists offer BOTOX Cosmetic® treatments at our downtown Nashville, TN, office to minimize the lines and wrinkles that may make you look and feel older than you are. The entire treatment process is simple, virtually painless, and typically takes less than 15 minutes to administer. Results generally last about six months, which means you can effectively maintain your dental care and your youthful appearance during your biannual checkup. Ask about BOTOX Cosmetic at your next visit.</p>

        Great experience, under the circumstances, needing an emergency fix for a badly chipped front tooth. The staff was friendly. Everything was explained with all questions answered and the end result was awesome. Dr. Harris is an artist :D restoring my million dollar smile ;-) Thx to everyone at Gulch Dental Studio!      </p>

<p>
        Having moved from Los Angeles in 2020 I had not been ready to visit a dentist in Nashville until today. Can’t believe I waited so long, almost felt like I was at a (tooth) spa! The dentist is very personable and geared to your individual needs. Jenna was my hygienist and was amazing, gentle yet super thorough. Wait for it, Dr. said I needed no treatment at my 50 years old I was excited to hear! And wait for it again, Dr. provides Botox cosmetic - I literally had the best dentist visit and got my eyebrows lifted in one hour!!!! If there was 10 stars I’d give 11      </p>
