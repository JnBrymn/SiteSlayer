## Transform Your Smile Discreetly

### Invisalign Orthodontic Treatment

If the only thing keeping you from a celebrity smile is the thought of braces, step through the doors of Gulch Dental Studio, offering [Invisalign in Nashville, TN](/services/invisalign/). We can create the smile you've been dreaming of using comfortable aligners, the virtually invisible solution for straightening teeth.

Invisalign uses a series of clear aligner trays that gently move your teeth into the correct position, benefitting the health, function, and appearance of your smile.

To ensure the best possible result, our dentists use advanced imaging systems that capture 3D scans of your teeth. Our exacting methods allow us to precisely plot the movement of each tooth for predictable results. We'll even show you a digital preview of your new smile so you can make an informed decision.

## Do You Have a Complicated Case?

Advances in Invisalign technology now allow even people with complex cases to take advantage of clear aligners. But Gulch Dental Studio goes a step further to ensure megawatt smiles. While our dentists are certified Invisalign providers, our team also includes an orthodontic specialist who has the advanced training to handle difficult orthodontic cases.

Is it time to find out what makes clear aligners so popular among patients of all ages?

## Our Specialties

## Porcelain Veneers

Stained, chipped, worn, or slightly crooked teeth affect not only your smile but also your confidence. The highly skilled dentists at Gulch Dental Studio can enhance your smile with ultra-thin dental veneers. We craft our custom [veneers in Nashville, TN,](/services/veneers/) with the finest materials, including IPS e.max® and IPS Empress®, which mimic the properties of natural enamel. This allows us to blend your new veneers with surrounding teeth for a seamless result. With the proper care, the highly advanced and exceptionally strong materials we use for our veneers can last over a decade.

## Dental Crowns

If you suffer from broken, chipped, or missing teeth, our dentists can restore the appearance and function of your smile with our metal-free cosmetic crowns. A dental cap covers the visible portion of a tooth to reinforce and preserve its structure, restoring a damaged tooth to its normal function. We exclusively use the highest quality materials such as IPS e.max and IPS Empress for our [dental crowns in Nashville, TN,](/services/dental-crowns/) to closely match the natural shade of your smile. These state-of-the-art materials allow us to restore your smile so that you can eat and chew comfortably again and boost your confidence in your appearance.

## BOTOX® Cosmetic

If you feel self-conscious about signs of aging surrounding your smile, we can help. Our dentists offer BOTOX Cosmetic® treatments at our downtown Nashville, TN, office to minimize the lines and wrinkles that may make you look and feel older than you are. The entire treatment process is simple, virtually painless, and typically takes less than 15 minutes to administer. Results generally last about six months, which means you can effectively maintain your dental care and your youthful appearance during your biannual checkup. Ask about BOTOX Cosmetic at your next visit.

## Stress-Free Dental Care We Offer Every Level of Sedation

With our high-end, luxurious surroundings, Gulch Dental Studio envelopes patients in a serene setting. But if that is not enough to keep you relaxed during treatment, we also offer sedation dentistry carefully matched to your needs.

Gulch Dental Studio is one of the rare dental practices in Nashville that offers every level of sedation. That allows us to provide each and every patient with a Goldilocks solution for treatment: The "just right" level of sedation for the procedure they are having, or for their level of anxiety.

Our dentists are thoroughly trained in providing nitrous oxide and oral sedation. However, if you have severe anxiety, we will bring in a licensed anesthesiologist so that you can get the treatment you need without unnecessary discomfort, and in the utmost safety.

Fine-Tune Your Comfort

Having moved from Los Angeles in 2020 I had not been ready to visit a dentist in Nashville until today. Can’t believe I waited so long, almost felt like I was at a (tooth) spa! The dentist is very personable and geared to your individual needs. Jenna was my hygienist and was amazing, gentle yet super thorough. Wait for it, Dr. said I needed no treatment at my 50 years old I was excited to hear! And wait for it again, Dr. provides Botox cosmetic - I literally had the best dentist visit and got my eyebrows lifted in one hour!!!! If there was 10 stars I’d give 11

## "I Was Very Impressed With Dr Harris." Treating You With Consideration and Attentiveness

Shaun Combs


I've been a patient at Gulch Dental Studio for a couple years now, and I've been extremely happy with the service I've received. The staff has always been very friendly and accommodating, and the hygienist that does my cleaning is very thorough yet efficient. My appointments have always run on-time as well, which is important for me since I'm usually taking time away from work. I also recently had an old filling replaced and I was very impressed with Dr Harris. He was incredibly fast and made me feel as comfortable throughout the process. I've been so pleased as a patient here, and I couldn't imagine a reason to go anywhere else.


Cameron Foltz


I visit Dr. Harris and the team at Gulch Dental Studio for my Botox appointments, and I always look forward to coming in. The office is GORGEOUS and so relaxing. The whole team is always kind and accommodating. Dr. Harris always takes time to make sure my concerns and preferences are heard before he gets started, and he never fails to make me laugh! Last but certainly not least, I'm always SO pleased with the results. It's nice to look in the mirror and not have to obsess about wrinkles or lines. And he has a gift for making it look really natural and not overdone. If you're considering trying Botox for the first time, go see Dr. Harris and the team at Gulch Dental Studio. They'll take such great care of you!

[(615) 953-3068](tel:6159533068)

## What We Can Correct With Custom Cosmetic Dentistry Procedures

### Tooth Discoloration

A single stained tooth or widespread tooth discoloration can be treated with teeth whitening or masked with bonding or veneers.

### Crooked Teeth

Minor misalignment can be effectively concealed with veneers, or we can move the teeth into alignment with [Invisalign in Nashville, TN](/services/invisalign/).

### Gapped Teeth

Gaps between the teeth can be closed with Invisalign, or we can use veneers or bonding to fill in the space between the teeth.

### Misshapen or Small Teeth

Misshapen or small teeth can affect the symmetry and balance of your smile. Veneers or bonding can add additional length or width to your teeth.

### Chipped or Cracked Teeth

Our dentists can conceal minor chips or cracks with bonding material, or we can mask them with [veneers in Nashville, TN](/services/veneers/).


## Cosmetic Treatment Options How We Can Give You a Beautiful Smile

The cosmetic dentists at our Nashville practice offer a comprehensive scope of treatments:

### [Dental Bonding](/services/dental-bonding/)

Dental bonding is designed to conceal imperfections. By applying a tooth-colored composite material that is shaded to blend with your surrounding teeth, your dentist can help you achieve a more beautiful, symmetrical appearance. Bonding can be performed on a single tooth or multiple teeth, and it is a conservative and affordable alternative to veneers. You can expect to enjoy the results of your bonding treatment for between five and 10 years before returning for a touch-up.

### [Porcelain Veneers](/services/veneers/)

Like bonding, porcelain veneers enhance the appearance of your anterior teeth. Your cosmetic dentist will design customized porcelain shells that fit over your teeth and blend in with your smile, covering flaws such as cracks, discoloration, gaps, minor misalignment, and more. This popular treatment can be used to enhance a single tooth or multiple teeth. Veneers provide a long-term cosmetic enhancement. They last 10 years or more on average.

### [Invisalign](/services/invisalign/)

Invisalign® straightens teeth using smooth, comfortable plastic aligners. By switching to a new set of customized trays every two weeks, you can discreetly and gently realign crooked teeth and a misaligned bite. We work closely with an orthodontist who visits our office for the best treatment results. It's important to keep in mind that Invisalign only treats mild-to-moderate misalignment. If you have a more complex case, our visiting orthodontist can recommend an alternative treatment.

### [Teeth Whitening](/services/teeth-whitening/)

Our doctors offer multiple options to help patients achieve a brighter smile, including in-office laser whitening, which can noticeably whiten your teeth in just one appointment. We also provide Opalescence Go™ and customized take-home trays, which can achieve comparable results to in-office whitening in just a few weeks. Take-home kits allow you to apply bleaching gel to custom trays at home to gradually illuminate your teeth for a healthier, more attractive appearance.

### [BOTOX Cosmetic](/services/botox/)

BOTOX® Cosmetic is an injectable treatment that blocks facial muscle contractions. You do not lose any sensation in your face or skin, and you can enjoy a smoother, more youthful-looking appearance. Each BOTOX treatment generally lasts from three to four months, depending on personal factors, and you'll be able to resume your regular daily activities immediately after your appointment. BOTOX is a proven, safe method for aesthetic enhancements.

### [Smile Makeovers](/services/smile-makeover/)

This comprehensive treatment plan combines multiple procedures to enhance multiple aspects of your smile at the same time.

## Are You a Candidate?

We want to make sure your smile is ready for long-lasting cosmetic results. During your consultation, we will consider:

### Your Oral Health

Prior to recommending cosmetic dentistry, your dentist will ensure your oral health is optimal and address and treat any underlying issues like [gum disease](/services/periodontics) or tooth decay. Cosmetic treatments are not advised for individuals with active dental problems.

### Your Goals

Cosmetic dentistry patients should set realistic expectations about their goals for treatment. Our dentists can offer personalized advice on achievable outcomes and suitable procedures to meet your dentistry goals.

### Your Daily Routine

All cosmetic dentistry procedures require you to take great care of your smile for the longest-lasting results. Some treatments may require being mindful of certain food or habits. We'll make sure you're fully equipped to make the most of your investment.


## Making Your Results Last

The results of your cosmetic dentistry treatment can last for several years. At a certain point, your dental veneers may be worn or your teeth become stained. No need to worry. Here are a few things you can do to keep your healthy smile looking its best.

- Practice Good Oral Hygiene – Proper at-home dental care will prevent stains, cavities, and other problems. Brush your teeth twice a day and floss at least once a day.
- Avoid Tobacco Products – Cigarettes, chewing tobacco, and vaping should all be avoided. This prevents tooth discoloration and reduces your risk of gum disease.
- Protect Your Teeth – Be sure to wear a mouth guard during sports and face protection during any activities that could cause injuries to the face or mouth.

### Regular Checkups and Cleanings

Be sure to visit our Nashville dentists every six months for routine exams and [professional cleanings](/services/teeth-cleaning). We can monitor the condition of your [dental crowns](/services/dental-crowns) and [veneers](/services/veneers) and let you know when you may need some additional treatment.

Whenever it's time for some touch-up work, our cosmetic dentists can discuss what procedures will be needed and how much it will cost. Like your initial treatment, we'll be sure to provide answers to any questions you may have.

## What About Missing or Damaged Teeth? Our Restorative Treatments Can Repair Your Smile

Our skilled dentists do more than just cosmetic dentistry. At our dental studio in Nashville, you can receive a range of restorative dentistry services that restore the health, form, and function of your smile. Each of these procedures is performed with the same artistry and customization we dedicate to aesthetic procedures. Some of our most popular restorative treatments include:

- ### [Dental Implants](/services/dental-implants/)

Dental implants are the best solution for missing teeth. They provide unparalleled stability for prosthetic teeth and critical support to your jawbone, helping to preserve your oral health and natural facial structure. Whether you need to replace a single tooth with an implant-supported dental crown or a full arch of teeth with an implant-supported denture, your results will look indistinguishable from the real thing and offer you the same ease when eating, speaking, and smiling.
- ### [Tooth-Colored Fillings](/services/fillings/)

We use a lifelike composite resin blend to create our dental fillings. This material can be color-matched to the precise shade of the enamel on the treated tooth. It is also resistant to especially hot and cold temperatures, which means it stays flush with your tooth and doesn't expand or contract as metal fillings can. If you have older metal fillings and you're ready for an upgrade, we can easily replace them with composite fillings to give your smile a more seamless look.
- ### [Full Mouth Reconstruction](/services/full-mouth-reconstruction/)

Considered the restorative counterpart to the smile makeover, a full mouth reconstruction gives you a way to address multiple issues that compromise the health and function of your smile at once. Your dentist will examine your teeth and speak with you about your treatment goals. The two of you will work together to choose a combination of restorative procedures that can completely transform your dental health, bite, and self-confidence by the end of your treatment.

## Cosmetic Dentistry FAQs

### Do you use traditional or digital impressions?

### Is there an orthodontist on staff?

Neither of our full-time dentists are orthodontists. However, we have an orthodontic specialist come into our Nashville office every other Friday to help with more complex cases that we cannot handle without their cooperation.

### What cosmetic dentistry qualifications do your dentists have?

General Dentistry - Nashville, TN - Gulch Dental Studio


# Enjoy the Benefits of Quality General Dentistry

Our doctors offer a comprehensive scope of general dentistry treatments at our practice. Our Nashville, TN, dental office is fully equipped to provide virtually any dental care you need. When your treatment is complete, you will be able to experience the comfort and peace of mind that comes with a healthy, beautiful smile.

Our office is fully equipped to provide virtually any dental care you need.

General dentistry consists of preventive procedures and other types of treatment meant to maintain and improve patients' oral health.

## General Dentistry Treatment Options

Whether you need a [routine cleaning](/services/teeth-cleaning), X-rays, or restorative treatments, our team can help you regain and maintain a healthy smile. Some of the general dentistry options we provide include:

### Extractions

[Tooth extraction](/services/tooth-extraction) is the process of fully removing a decayed, damaged, or injured tooth that may be threatening the overall oral health of a patient. This is done when a tooth cannot be repaired or restored with a [dental crown](/services/dental-crowns), inlay, or onlay. When decay or bacterial buildup is allowed to remain, they eventually spread and damage the healthy surrounding teeth and gum tissue. Extractions are commonly performed using local anesthesia, in addition to any necessary sedation.

### Sedation Options

[Sedation dentistry](/services/sedation-dentistry) is a useful tool that helps anxious or fearful patients receive the dental treatment they need to maintain optimal oral health. There are different levels of sedation available, ranging from nitrous oxide to oral medication or general anesthesia. We take the safety and comfort of our patients very seriously, and will always prioritize your health.

### Root Canal Therapy

[Root canal therapy](/services/root-canal) involves the removal of bacterial build-up and infected tissue inside of a tooth before sealing and restoring it with a dental crown. This option helps preserve a severely compromised tooth rather than extracting it completely. Despite the common misconception that root canals are very uncomfortable, with sedation dentistry and local anesthetic, our patients often compare the process to a dental filling.

### Wisdom Teeth Removal

When your wisdom teeth are impacted or growing in irregularly, it may be in your best interest to remove them completely. This can also help when your mouth is too crowded and you need to preserve the effects of previous orthodontic treatment. Similar to tooth extraction, you will receive local anesthetic and sedation, if necessary, to make sure you are comfortable. Sometimes wisdom teeth, also known as third molars, need to be broken into pieces before they can be fully extracted. After the [wisdom tooth removal procedure](/services/wisdom-teeth-removal), you will be given explicit instructions on how to manage discomfort and shorten recovery time.

### Oral Surgery

[Oral surgery](/services/oral-surgery) includes a diverse range of treatments, from complex tooth extraction to TMJ repair. Patients who choose [dental implants](/services/dental-implants) undergo a surgical procedure to place the titanium posts in the jawbone, and your doctor can perform bone grafts if the jaw needs to be strengthened. We can refer patients to trusted local physicians, as needed.

### Cleanings and Exams

The most common general dentistry procedures are routine [cleanings and examinations](/services/teeth-cleaning). Staying up-to-date with your dental care and following up with your doctor regularly not only helps you maintain good oral health but also plays a key role in preventing any problems before they become complicated. Our team will conduct an [oral cancer screening](/services/oral-cancer-screening) during your dental examination to help detect serious issues at their earliest stages.

### Periodontal Therapy

Gum disease is the leading cause of tooth loss among adults in the U.S. [Periodontal therapy](/services/periodontics) can help manage its effects and restore your oral health. Depending on your needs, the doctors may recommend scaling and root planing, also known as a deep cleaning, or surgical treatment.

### TMJ Disorder Treatment

The TMJs are active during chewing, talking, yawning, or laughing. Each side is also an intricate part of the facial structure, containing a small joint that can cause headaches and other problems when impaired. We offer [several TMJ disorder treatment options](/services/tmj/), depending on the severity of the case, and can often provide relief with a simple oral appliance. [BOTOX® injections](/services/botox) have also been found to be effective in providing therapeutic benefits.

## Schedule an Exam Today

Whether you need a routine cleaning or more in-depth treatment, our experienced dentists can provide you with quality care and lasting results. To learn more about our general dentistry options or to schedule an appointment, contact us [online](/contact).


Restorative Dentistry - Nashville, TN - Gulch Dental Studio


# Repair Your Smile with Restorative Dentistry

Restorative dentistry is often recommended to improve the function and form of teeth that have been affected by decay, trauma, or other damage. Our doctors offer a range of procedures at our Nashville, TN, dental office, including durable, natural-looking [crowns](/services/dental-crowns), [bridges](/services/dental-bridges), or dentures. Your dentist will always take the time to listen to your goals and concerns, answering all your questions and determining which treatment plan is best for your unique needs. For patients paying out of pocket, we accept CareCredit® financing, because we believe that everyone deserves a healthy, radiant smile.

Damaged or missing teeth can cause a cascade of related issues. Prompt treatment is necessary to protect your dental function and appearance.

## Commonly Performed Procedures

Restorative dentistry is a branch of dental care that focuses on replacing or strengthening damaged teeth while helping patients recover their ability to eat, smile, and speak comfortably. Rather than emphasizing the cosmetic appeal of your smile, restorative treatment aims to improve patients' oral health.

Your dentist will always take the time to listen to your goals and concerns, answering all your questions and determining which treatment plan is best for your unique needs.

Whether you need a [tooth extraction](/services/tooth-extraction), chipped tooth repair, cavity repair, or a [full mouth reconstruction](/services/full-mouth-reconstruction), these types of procedures can help you get back to your normal routine. Restorative dentistry offers several versatile treatment options and approaches including:

### Dental Implants

[Dental implants](/services/dental-implants) are surgically placed titanium posts inserted into your jaw bone. After several months, a process called osseointegration fuses the titanium with your jawbone, creating a stable and permanent foundation for restorations. By replacing missing dental roots, implants preserve a strong, healthy jaw. We can evaluate your candidacy, coordinate care, and refer you to a trusted doctor for the placement of implants, then provide beautiful-looking restorations.

### Dental Crowns and Bridges

Traditional [dental crowns](/services/dental-crowns) are designed to strengthen and protect weak, damaged teeth. An implant-supported crown can replace a single missing tooth. Our office also offers all-ceramic crowns and [IPS e.max®](/services/ips-emax-crowns) dental crowns. Whether traditional or implant-supported, [dental bridges](/services/dental-bridges) can replace one or more adjacent missing teeth and allow you to eat and chew comfortably again. This is also a good option for preserving the alignment of your remaining teeth and the youthful shape of your cheeks and face.

### Dentures

Implant-supported dentures are similar to implant-supported bridges in that the restorations are attached to permanent implants. This option is better for your jaw bone density and preservation in the long run, because simply wearing dentures on top of your gums allows the jawbone to atrophy underneath.

### Full Mouth Reconstruction

A [full mouth reconstruction](/services/full-mouth-reconstruction) treatment plan often includes extractions, implants, and different restoration options. Patients eligible for this treatment are usually those missing several teeth. They might also be suffering from extensive damage due to decay, which is often coupled with gum disease. In these cases, your doctor may need to perform gum or bone grafts to reinforce your gums or jawbone.

### Tooth-Colored Fillings

[Dental fillings](/services/fillings) are often sufficient for small to medium-sized cavities in one or more teeth. This treatment can strengthen your bite and prevent further problems once your doctor has removed all the damaged or decayed tissue.

### Amalgam Filling Replacement

Our doctors prefer tooth-colored fillings for their numerous benefits. In addition to offering new fillings made of composite, we can also replace older amalgam restorations.

By improving function, restorative dentistry often results in a more aesthetic smile in the process. However, patients who want even more significant cosmetic improvements can benefit from combining restorative treatments with [porcelain veneers](/services/veneers) or [teeth whitening](/services/teeth-whitening).

## Restore Your Health and Appearance

If you are suffering from extensive damage to your teeth or gums, we offer compassionate care and personalized plans for every need. To learn more about our restorative dentistry options or to schedule a consultation, [contact us using our online form](/contact).


Invisalign Nashville, TN - Clear Aligners - Gulch Dental Studio


# Invisalign

Are you afraid to show your smile due to crooked teeth? Looking for a discrete way to straighten your smile that doesn't involve braces?

Invisalign® clear aligners are a comfortable and simplified orthodontic treatment for many misalignment issues.

Our team in Nashville, TN, can use Invisalign to straighten your teeth and get you back to smiling with confidence.

[Call (615) 953-3068](tel:+16159533068)
[Request a Consultation](/consultation)

## What Is Invisalign?

/

Invisalign is a series of clear plastic aligners molded to fit your teeth in a way that applies constant but gentle pressure, causing your teeth to straighten. They are an orthodontic landmark and a great alternative to metal brackets and wires for those with minor to moderate alignment issues. Our [cosmetic dentistry in Nashville, TN](/services/cosmetic-dentistry/), is the best way to upgrade your smile, and we are here to help you experience the benefits of Invisalign treatment.

## How Clear Aligners Work

Like braces, Invisalign is designed to move your teeth a little at a time. After digital impressions are taken by your dentist, you will receive a series of plastic aligners to adjust your teeth and gradually shift them into the proper position. It is recommended that you wear your aligners 22 hours each day, removing them only to eat or drink liquids other than water. Each set of aligners is worn about two weeks before moving onto the next set.

## Pros and Cons of Invisalign Aligners

### Pros

Invisible

The completely clear plastic makes Invisalign virtually undetectable while wearing the aligners.

Removable

Being removable makes Invisalign easy to clean and gives you the freedom to eat anything you like.

Effective

Invisalign is a quick and effective tool to achieve a straight smile. With proper use, you could see your new smile in as little as six months.

Affordable

Patients are often thrilled to learn that [Invisalign is comparable in price to traditional orthodontic treatment](/services/invisalign/cost).

### Cons

Easily Lost

Since the aligners are removable, they can easily be lost or misplaced. This is generally a concern for parents who have teenagers using Invisalign. However, Invisalign First (previously Invisalign Teen) comes with replacement aligners for this reason. No matter what, be sure to take care whenever removing your aligners so you know where they are at all times.

Staining

Clear aligners can become stained by certain foods and drinks. This is why it is so important to be sure your mouth is rinsed and cleaned before reinserting your aligners.

Only for Mild to Moderate Cases

Invisalign is effective for most misalignment cases, but for more severe cases, they may not be enough. That is why talking with your dentist is always the first step in developing a treatment plan to straighten your teeth.

## Get a Straighter Smile Without Braces Ask Our Nashville, TN, Team About Invisalign

amanda lofdahl


Such nice people! I hate the dentist and they made me feel so comfortable and at ease. Super super recommend.


## Cost of Invisalign

Since each person's dental care plan is unique, the cost of Invisalign at our Nashville practice will vary for each patient. Typically, Invisalign is around the same price as traditional metal braces, and many basic insurance plans will contribute to the cost of this treatment. Reach out to our team to learn more about our [CareCredit®](https://www.carecredit.com/go/QWR254) financing options and how we can create a custom treatment plan for any budget.

## Our Certified Invisalign Doctor in Nashville

[Dr. Scott Harris](/doctors/scott-harris-dds) recently became a fully certified Invisalign doctor. This means patients can benefit from his expertise as well as serious cost savings.

[Message Us to Learn More](/contact)

## Invisalign Candidacy

While our dentist in Nashville, TN, uses Invisalign to treat various orthodontic concerns, not everyone is a good candidate. You may be a good candidate if:

- Your concerns are mild to moderate: More severe orthodontic issues are best treated with traditional treatments like braces.
- You're committed to treatment: Invisalign is most effective when worn for 20 to 22 hours a day. You must be committed to wearing your trays for the best results.
- You're in good oral health: If you have issues like gum disease or tooth decay, these should be addressed before your treatment begins.

## The Process of Invisalign Treatment at Our Nashville, TN, Practice

Each patient's smile is unique, so each treatment plan will be personalized to their needs.

### Assessment and Imaging

Your dentist will evaluate your overall oral health, then take a series of X-rays, photographs, and impressions of your teeth.

### Planning Treatment

Based on your examination and imaging, your dentist can design a custom orthodontic treatment plan. They will then work with the aligner software to develop your clear aligners.

### Receive Your Aligners

Once the aligners are created, you will wear them in stages based on your dentist's recommendation. Because your teeth will be shifting differently with each aligner set, you will periodically visit our office so your dentist can see how you are progressing.

### Enjoy Your New Smile

Once you reach the end of the series of aligners, no more aligners are needed. However, just like with braces, you will need to wear a retainer to keep your teeth in place.
[Request Your Orthodontic Consultation](tel:+16159533068)

## How to Care for Your Clear Aligners

Maintaining routine dental care and [dental checkups](/services/teeth-cleaning) is always the first step in keeping your teeth and gums healthy. Below are more ways to ensure your teeth and aligners remain functional and clean:

### Clean Your Invisalign Trays When You Brush Your Teeth

Clean your trays each time you brush and floss your teeth. The best way to clean your aligners is by using the Invisalign Cleaning System. However, denture cleaner is another great way to clean your aligners without damaging them. Do not use extremely hot or cold water when cleaning trays: extreme temperatures can warp the shape, making them ineffective.

### Rinse After Eating

Don't let anything – especially food particles and bacteria – get between your teeth and your aligners. Since Invisalign clear aligners are removable, be sure to rinse your mouth well with lukewarm water before putting your aligners back in after eating. When possible, brushing your teeth before wearing your aligners is even better.

### Know When to Remove Your Aligner

Drinking things like sodas, coffee, and alcoholic beverages while wearing Invisalign means those acids and sugars will sit on your teeth until you remove the aligner. This can cause oral health issues, such as cavities and staining. If you are consuming something besides water, be sure to remove Invisalign first, and then brush your teeth once you're done.

## Not Sure if Invisalign Is Right for You? Request a Consultation Today

Invisalign is a discreet option for many orthodontic concerns. However, not everyone is a good candidate for this orthodontic alternative. During your Invisalign consultation at our Nashville practice, your dentist will examine your mouth and discuss your history and goals to help you determine if this treatment is right for you.

To get started, [request a consultation online](/contact) or call our practice today.

## Invisalign Versus Traditional Braces

### Aesthetics

The main reason patients prefer Invisalign over braces is that they are transparent and virtually undetectable when worn. On the other hand, traditional braces have brackets and wires that are very visible and can affect your confidence.

### Comfort

Invisalign feels more like your natural teeth than the brackets and wires of braces. Traditional braces can rub on your tongue and soft oral tissues, leaving them irritated. In addition, switching clear aligners is far easier than getting the wires tightened on your braces.

### Easier to Clean

Not only is it easier to clean your clear aligners than braces, but it is also easier to clean your teeth as well. Since they are removable, you can brush and floss your teeth as you normally would. That also means no foods are off-limits when undergoing Invisalign treatment!

## Frequently Asked Questions  About Invisalign at Our Nashville, TN, Practice

### Don't I need to visit an orthodontist for Invisalign?

No. Though an orthodontist specializes in orthodontic concerns, our dentists are trained in using Invisalign to straighten smiles. The benefit of seeing a dentist over an orthodontist is that you can undergo [treatment for a wide variety of needs](/services) at our Nashville office, including routine check-ups and cleanings. This means all your dental care can be handled under one roof, rather than by visiting both a dentist and an orthodontist.

### How long does Invisalign treatment take?

This will depend on your orthodontic concerns. Some mild issues can be corrected in as little as six months, while more moderate issues can require 12 to 18 months.

### Can my child undergo Invisalign treatment?

This will vary from child to child. A good candidate for Invisalign will be responsible enough to wear their clear aligners for 20 to 22 hours a day and maintain the trays.

### Will I need to wear retainers after?

We recommend wearing retainers after any orthodontics treatment, whether that be Invisalign or traditional braces. Wearing a retainer after you're done with your series of custom Invisalign trays prevents your teeth from gradually shifting out of alignment. However, every case is unique; we'll walk you through what you can expect following treatment.

## Ready for an Even More Youthful Appearance?

A straighter smile is just one step towards an overall younger look. That is why our Nashville, TN, office proudly offers BOTOX® Cosmetic. Reducing laugh lines and crows' feet can complement your newly straightened smile for powerful rejuvenation.

Veneers Nashville, TN - Porcelain Veneers - Gulch Dental Studio


# Veneers

Do you hide your smile while out in public? Dental veneers can conceal cosmetic flaws to enhance the appearance of your teeth.

Our dentists at Gulch Dental Studio in Nashville, TN, can artfully place veneers to boost your confidence.


## What Are Porcelain Veneers?

A porcelain veneer, also called a dental veneer, is an ultra-thin shell that our [dentist in Nashville, TN](/), can attach to the surface of a tooth. Once bonded to the tooth, veneers obscure cosmetic concerns like chips, cracks, or stains. Each shell is made from porcelain or similar materials that flawlessly resemble the appearance of a natural tooth.

Porcelain veneers have become one of the most popular treatment options in cosmetic dentistry because they are relatively easy to place and yield exceptional lifelike results.

## Check Out These Natural-Looking Results Dental Veneers Can Create Stunning Smiles

Before Dental Veneers and Crowns
After Dental Veneers and Crowns
Both [crowns](/services/dental-crowns) and porcelain veneers were used to conceal deep staining and gaps between this patient's teeth to create a stunning, cohesive smile. This combination of durable wafer-thin shells and tooth-colored restorations look just like natural teeth, with results that will last longer than [professional whitening treatments](/services/teeth-whitening) or the use of resin [bonding](/services/dental-bonding) materials.

## Patients Love Gulch Dental Studio Read Some of Our 5-Star Reviews from Actual Patients

Katherine


The team here is great! Switched to this facility after a bad experience with a dentist. Prior one ignored my concerns with pain and did shoddy dental work. Dr. Harris is SO knowledgeable and kind as he helped me get my teeth back on track. I've spent a lot of time in this office and I can't recommend enough!!!! Truly a great experience overall.


Sam Stallings


Dr. Harris and his team are amazing at what they do. They are friendly, professional, and best of all work extremely efficiently. Dr. Harris was able to do a multitude of fillings in around an hour. He even removed several stains on my teeth that I thought were permanent! Best experience at the dentist I have had.


## How Much Do Veneers Cost?

The cost of getting dental veneers can vary based on a number of factors. This includes the number of veneers needed and the amount of preparatory work required before veneer placement can proceed.

During the consultation process here at Gulch Dental Studio, we can perform a full examination and provide a custom price quote so you can determine if veneers fit your current budget.

## Are Veneers Covered by Dental Insurance?


No. As a cosmetic dentistry procedure, dental veneers are considered an elective treatment rather than medically necessary. Thankfully, our [financing options](/patient-forms) can keep veneer treatment affordable for many households. We can also go over cheaper alternative treatments that may be right for you.

## Concerned About the Cost of Veneers? Financing Options Are Available for Your Dental Work

## Working Within Your Budget

Our doctors want to make the life-changing, long-lasting benefits of veneers accessible to as many patients as possible. We will work closely with you to design a treatment that suits your needs, budget, and end goals.

## Keeping Dental Care Affordable

Veneers are cosmetic and not covered by insurance. To make treatment more affordable, we accept [CareCredit®](https://www.carecredit.com/go/QWR254), a third-party financing option that offers low-interest and interest-free repayment plans.

## Ideal Dental Veneer Candidates Are in Good Oral Health

In general, the most important requirement affecting your ability to receive dental veneers is robust oral health. If you have major oral health issues, such as severe tooth decay or gum disease, other treatments will be necessary before you qualify for [cosmetic dentistry](/services/cosmetic-dentistry). We can address virtually all of these concerns at our practice. Other factors that affect candidacy for porcelain veneers include:

### Whether You Have Sufficient Enamel

Before your dentist can place your porcelain veneers, they have to remove a certain amount of enamel from your tooth. If you have very worn or thin enamel, you may not qualify for this form of dentistry.

### Whether You Grind Your Teeth

Clenching or grinding your teeth can damage restorations like veneers. An oral appliance or another treatment for these issues may allow you to still undergo treatment.

### Minor Misalignment Only

While porcelain veneers can address gaps or other minor types of misalignment, severely crooked teeth may still require orthodontic treatment, such as [Invisalign](/services/invisalign)®.

### Good Oral Hygiene

Consistent oral hygiene and [regular checkups](/services/teeth-cleaning) at our office in Nashville, TN, are essential for maintaining the integrity of the dental veneers and the health of your underlying teeth.

### Ready for a Permanent Investment

Veneer dentistry is irreversible. If you are concerned about making permanent changes to your smile, you may want to consider an alternative treatment, such as [dental bonding](/services/dental-bonding). Our team will be happy to discuss your options with you.

## The Porcelain Veneers Timeline What You Can Expect

Placing veneers is an irreversible but minimally invasive procedure that can give you a stunning smile that lasts for over a decade.
Dental veneers can enhance your smile in just two office visits. The process is minimally invasive and virtually painless.

### Preparation:

First, your dentist will prepare each tooth that will receive a porcelain veneer by removing a thin layer of enamel. This step makes space to ensure the thin shell fits seamlessly onto the tooth.

### Impressions:

Your dentist will then take impressions of your prepped teeth to create a wax mock-up. This allows you to see what your veneers will look like before treatment moves forward. We can make any requested changes to the design at this stage.

### Fabrication:

Once we decide on specifics like color and shape, we will send your impressions to a trusted dental lab. In the meantime, you will receive temporary veneers that still allow you to chew and speak normally. Follow our instructions for proper care of these temporary veneers.

### Placement:

Before placing your veneers, your dentist will test them for fit and aesthetics. Your dentist will then remove the temporary veneers and clean each prepared tooth with a cleansing solution designed to aid in the bonding process. The bonding agent is then applied to your teeth, and the dentist will secure your final veneers in place.

## Life After Veneers


One of the greatest benefits of veneers is that you can begin to enjoy the results almost immediately. There is virtually no recovery or downtime needed, and your veneers will be ready to show off as soon as you leave our downtown Nashville dental office.

## Caring for Porcelain Veneers Is Simple MAINTAIN THE BEAUTY OF YOUR ENHANCED SMILE

Though we use durable, high-quality materials, veneers will still need to be replaced at some point. Excellent oral hygiene and continued care of your teeth and gums can extend the lifespan of your veneers.

## Brush and Floss Regularly

You should continue good oral hygiene habits like brushing twice daily and flossing at least once daily. Maintaining the health of your teeth and gums is one of the best ways to ensure the longevity of your porcelain veneers.

## Attend Routine Dental Visits

Coming to our office in the Gulch twice a year for [routine cleanings](/services/teeth-cleaning) will help maintain the health of your teeth and gums as well as extend the lifespan of your veneers and any other new restorations.

## Avoid Biting Hard Surfaces

While the porcelain material we use is highly durable, it is not indestructible. You should avoid chewing on ice, biting your nails, nibbling on pens, and opening packaging with your teeth. These actions can chip or damage your veneers.

## Avoid Teeth Grinding

Teeth grinding can chip, crack, or wear down your porcelain veneers. If you grind your teeth during the night, our doctors can recommend an oral appliance that helps you avoid putting excessive pressure on your veneers.

## Want to Transform Your Smile? Take the First Step by Contacting Our Practice

Is there something about your smile you want to change? Do you have prominent chips, cracks, or gaps? Do you have crooked or misshapen teeth? [Gulch Dental Studio](/) can help.

Veneers could be the dental treatment you've been waiting for. The stain-resistant material used to make them is strong and blends in with your natural teeth, allowing you to bite, chew, speak, and smile with confidence.

## Alternatives to Veneers Other Treatments for Patients to Consider

Don't feel bad if you are unable to afford veneers or if they just aren't right for your needs. Depending on the issues you want to address, our dentists in Nashville, TN, can discuss potential alternatives to porcelain veneers.

## Dental Bonding


Dental bonding is used to treat many of the same conditions as veneers for a lower price. Instead of a porcelain shell, the dental bonding process uses a resin material that is carefully shaped and molded to the tooth.

While bonding is a good alternative for treating an imperfect tooth, the resin bonding material cannot provide the same level of strength and durability that veneer materials can. That said, many patients are satisfied with this more affordable alternative.

[Explore Dental Bonding](/services/dental-bonding)

## Teeth Whitening

Professional teeth whitening is another more affordable alternative to veneers. Both in-office whitening and take-home whitening kits can be effective at treating stains that originate on the surface of the teeth.

We always remind patients that their teeth can still become stained after whitening treatment. Good oral hygiene and avoiding tobacco products can keep smiles looking bright and white. In addition, periodic touchup procedures can prolong the results.

[Explore Teeth Whitening](/services/teeth-whitening)

## Invisalign

Veneers can be used to treat minor tooth misalignment, but sometimes orthodontics is the better option. This ensures your teeth look straight and can prevent oral health problems such as teeth grinding and TMJ disorders.

Gulch Dental Studios offers Invisalign instead of traditional metal braces. Thanks to the clear plastic aligner trays used during the months-long procedure, you can complete Invisalign treatment without anyone noticing you're undergoing orthodontic care.

[Explore Invisalign](/services/invisalign)

## Which Procedure Is Right for Me?


When you come into our Nashville, TN, dentistry practice for your cosmetic consultation, one of our experienced dentists will go over your oral health and aesthetic goals to determine which procedure is best for you. Our dentist takes pride in educating patients and being honest about the treatment that will give them the best results.

## Porcelain Veneer FAQ

### How long do dental veneers last?

With proper at-home care and regular trips to see the dentist, your new dental veneers can last for over a decade. After about 10-15 years, your dental veneers will need to be replaced. The process for replacing old dental veneers is quite similar to the initial veneer placement procedure.

### Will dental veneers ruin my teeth?

No. Just a small amount of tooth enamel is removed while prepping a tooth for a dental veneer. Typically, just a half millimeter of enamel is removed, and sometimes less. Losing a fraction of a millimeter of enamel will not have a significant impact on the structural integrity of a tooth or your oral health.

### Can I smoke after getting dental veneers?

You technically can smoke or use chewing tobacco after getting dental veneers, but it's a bad idea. The veneers will not become stained, but tobacco products will discolor your natural teeth and increase your risk of [gum disease](/services/periodontics). We often tell patients that getting dental veneers is a convenient excuse to kick their smoking or chewing tobacco habit for good.

### What should I do if a veneer gets chipped or comes loose?

If a dental veneer is fractured or somehow gets dislodged, it's important that you contact our Nashville practice as soon as possible. Bring the debonded veneer or broken fragment with you if possible. Our dental team can assess the issue and determine the most effective treatment for this dental veneer problem.

### Why are veneers from veneer techs so cheap?

Veneers from veneer techs are cheap because veneer techs are not licensed dental care professionals. In fact, their work is illegal and potentially dangerous. All it takes to be a veneer tech is a little training for a meaningless certificate. Veneer techs also use substandard tools and materials when doing their dental work. There is a risk of lasting tooth damage and poor cosmetic results. This is why it's worth spending extra money to get your dental veneers from an experienced and qualified cosmetic dentist.

## It's All About Comfort

We know that many patients perceive a trip to the dentist as cold, clinical, and even scary.

But our office is modern, comfortable, luxurious, and warm. We want every patient to feel at home, so we maintain a relaxing environment that feels more like a spa than a dentist's office.

If you suffer from dental anxiety, we also offer various methods of [sedation dentistry](/services/sedation-dentistry), including:

- Nitrous oxide
- Oral conscious sedation
- Intravenous (IV) sedation
- General anesthesia


## Metal-Free Crowns Have Serious Benefits

When you choose to receive a dental crown at our Nashville dental office, you can:

### Preserve Your Tooth

A dental crown is a cap that covers the visible portion of a tooth, reinforcing and preserving its structure. This means we can restore a damaged tooth to normal function so that you can eat and chew comfortably again.

### Receive Fast Treatment

Thanks to our advanced technology, we can prep your tooth for a crown, mill the restoration, and place your new crown all in one appointment. Same-day crowns mean there's no need for a temporary restoration and follow-up visit.

### Experience Durable, Lasting Results

We exclusively use high-quality, porcelain-like materials, such as IPS Empress® and [IPS e.max® crowns in Nashville, TN](/services/ips-emax-crowns/). With proper care, these dental crowns can last 10 years or more before requiring replacement.

### Enjoy Natural-Looking Results

Your custom crown will be carefully designed to complement the shape of nearby teeth and specially matched to the natural shade of your smile so it blends in for a natural-looking appearance and fit.


## We've Got Your Solution

Our dentists utilize crowns to treat a variety of dental concerns, including:

- Tooth Decay
- Dental Trauma
- Root Canal Infections
- Cosmetic Concerns
- Missing Teeth
- Excessive Wear


## Is a Crown Right for Me?

### Sufficient Tooth Structure

In order for a traditional crown to successfully restore your smile, there must be at least one-third of the affected tooth intact. Your dentist will need to gently reshape the tooth before placing the dental restoration.

### Special Requirements for Implants

If you have a single missing tooth, an implant-supported crown can restore the appearance and function of your smile. However, dental implants have a unique set of requirements. Our dentists can determine if you qualify for implant dentistry and coordinate your treatment with a skilled oral surgeon.

## “My smile looks so good.”

"I had some crowns replaced and bonding repaired to my front teeth! Dr. Harris did phenomenal work! My smile looks so good. It really helps my confidence. The crowns were quickly replaced and the modern technology allowed them to immediately put them on in one office visit. No need to wait for weeks and suffer with annoying temporary crowns." — Valerie, [5-Star Review](https://g.co/kgs/PQMqds1)

## Why Our Crowns Look Exceptional

At [Gulch Dental Studio](/) in Nashville, TN, we go the extra mile to ensure your comfort and convenience. Our office is equipped with all the most modern restorative technology available in dentistry, and we will always prioritize your individual needs and goals.

### IPS e.max

Many people equate dental crowns with silver or other metals. Our practice uses metal-free materials like IPS e.max. IPS e.max is a ceramic material, much like porcelain, that provides more natural-looking results than silver or gold. Because it is metal-free, it is a great option for patients with metal sensitivities or allergies. IPS e.max is also durable and feels more like natural tooth enamel. During your first visit, we will review the advantages and disadvantages of the different materials available to you.

### Sirona CEREC

At Gulch Dental Studio, we offer same-day crowns. If your doctor determines you qualify for a same-day crown, we can use our in-office milling machine to craft the restoration while you wait. We use the latest generation of the Sirona CEREC system which offers a range of benefits. With this technology, there's no need for a temporary crown or a second visit. We can also use digital impressions and customize your crown to your exact preferences.

## Ready to Take the Next Steps?

### Request Your Consultation Today

Living with a damaged or decayed tooth can affect your oral health and lead to further complications if left untreated. We offer a wide variety of treatments so you can get the care you need in one convenient location.

We understand that dental treatments can be a bit overwhelming, but we are here to guide you every step of the way. Each patient is treated as an individual, and our dentists take the time to listen to you so your needs and concerns can be thoroughly addressed. Call our Nashville dental office or [contact us](/contact) online to request your initial consultation today.

### “You will have an excellent experience.”

"I just came out of a follow up visit. Dr. Harris puts his patients’ experience as a professional priority. The fine tuning of the crown firms up my opinion. You will have an excellent experience at Gulch Dental Studio." — Blade, [5-Star Review](https://g.co/kgs/5j38sf5)


## We Got You

"I had a crown pop off while flossing. Called Gulch Dental who were able to see me within a few hours. Staff and Doctor were all very friendly and were able to reinstall my crown quickly and with no pain." — Mark, [5-Star Review](https://g.co/kgs/uQcwwNN)

## Crowns: A Timeline

If you're a candidate for a same-day dental crown, this is what you can expect during your visit:

We offer sedation to keep you calm and comfortable throughout your visit.

### Tooth Preparation

During your first appointment, you will come in for an exam. Your dentist will remove any decay present in the tooth, first numbing the area so that you are comfortable. If your tooth is infected, we may perform [root canal therapy in Nashville, TN](/services/root-canal/). After the bacteria and decay are taken care of, we will remove a layer of enamel to make room for the restoration.

### Impressions

When the tooth is prepared, we will take impressions that will guide our automated tools in crafting your custom crown.

### Crown Placement

Your crown will be ready in about an hour. Your dentist will check the fit before securing it in place, and can make any fine adjustments necessary to give you a comfortable, balanced bite.

### Long-Term Results

Before you leave, you will receive detailed instructions on how to care for your dental crown. With good oral hygiene and [twice-yearly cleanings and exams](https://www.gulchdentalstudio.com/services/teeth-cleaning), our high-quality restorations can improve both the function and health of your tooth and the appearance of your smile for many years to come.

## Making Crowns Last

Taking care of your dental crown is fairly easy. For the most part, you should treat your restoration like you would a natural tooth. However, to ensure your crown lasts for as long as possible, we recommend following these simple instructions:

- ### Practice Good Oral Hygiene

The best way to maintain your crown and your natural teeth is to practice good oral hygiene. Brush your teeth with a soft-bristled toothbrush at least twice a day and floss at least once a day.
- ### Be Careful What You Chew

While our ceramic and IPS e.max crowns are highly durable, they can still crack under pressure. Refrain from biting down on anything extremely hard or sticky like ice cubes or toffee to prevent damage.
- ### Visit the Dentist

You should attend a checkup twice a year at our Nashville office to have your teeth professionally examined and cleaned. At this time your dentist will inspect your dental crown and make sure it is in good shape.

## Other Solutions

- ### [Dental Fillings in Nashville, TN](/services/fillings/)

Small cavities can often be corrected with a dental filling. Fillings preserve your tooth structure and our dentists will always consider this conservative method first before other treatments. If the decay has progressed and is affecting a significant portion of the tooth, a crown may be the best option.
- ### [Tooth Extraction in Nashville, TN](/services/tooth-extraction/)

Our dentist will always try to save a tooth, but sometimes they're past the point of repair. If you have a painful tooth that's putting your oral health at risk, our team will use gentle methods to extract it. We can then explore options to replace the tooth to restore your bite and keep the surrounding teeth in place.

- ### [Veneers](/services/veneers/)

If you wish to conceal deep dental stains that won't respond to teeth whitening, our dentists may suggest a veneer before a crown. A veneer is a thin porcelain shell that fits over the front of a tooth to conceal flaws. They are a more conservative treatment option that removes less enamel from the tooth structure.
- ### [Dental Bridges in Nashville, TN](/services/dental-bridges/)

A bridge consists of a prosthetic tooth sandwiched between two traditional dental crowns. The crowns are placed over the natural teeth adjacent to the gap to hold the prosthetic in place. If you're not a candidate for dental implants, a traditional bridge can fill the gap in your smile just as well.

If crowns alone aren't enough to restore your oral health, our team can develop a plan to completely overhaul your smile. In addition to reinforcing teeth with crowns, we can treat decay with fillings, eliminate infections with root canal therapy, and replace teeth with bridges or implant-supported restorations. Treatment will be tailored to your needs.

## Replacing Teeth

### With Dental Crowns

While a traditional crown caps a tooth that's been damaged, there's also a crown option for missing teeth: implant-supported crowns. These restorations require a dental implant to replace the missing tooth roots in your jaw. Implants protect against serious oral health problems, like jawbone atrophy that occurs after tooth loss. They also support restorations to replace teeth above the gumline.

We refer patients to a trusted oral surgeon in the area to place [dental implants in Nashville, TN](/services/dental-implants/). Once the implant is ready, you can return to our office where we'll take impressions and create a custom crown with maximum stability. Your replacement will look, feel, and function just like your natural teeth.


## Dental Crown FAQ

### Does getting a dental crown hurt?

No; while you may feel some pressure or sensitivity, thanks to modern dentistry getting a crown is virtually painless. You will be numbed using a local anesthetic before your dentist begins treatment. For those who need an extra level of comfort or for those with dental phobia or anxiety, our Nashville practice offers [multiple forms of sedation](/services/sedation-dentistry) to ensure the most comfortable and positive dental experience possible.

### Why not just pull a damaged tooth?

Many patients often ask if [extracting a damaged tooth](/services/tooth-extraction) is better or more affordable than a crown. The short answer is no. While it may seem like a quick solution, preserving a tooth is always best. Your jawbone can deteriorate without the stimulation tooth roots provide. What's more, a missing tooth lets nearby teeth shift position. By treating a damaged tooth with a dental crown, you can preserve the tooth structure. Extractions are only done when saving the tooth is not an option.

### Will my crown ever need to be replaced?

Even the best materials will wear over time and will eventually need to be replaced. However, with proper maintenance, your dental crown can last for 10 years or longer. Practice good oral health habits like brushing and flossing and getting [routine dental cleanings](/services/teeth-cleaning) to keep your crown looking its best. If you grind your teeth, your dentist may suggest a night guard to prevent wear to your dental crown and natural teeth.

"Dr. Harris and his hygienist Hannah are amazing. Had an appointment for a crown and I was in and out in under 2 hours. They were caring, funny, and always worrying so I didn’t have to. Thank you! ☺️" — Steve, [5-Star Review](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UAp1iJXjtFvsogcq8)


Sedation Dentistry Nashville, TN - Gulch Dental Studio


# Sedation Dentistry

Are you the kind of person who would choose to stay at home with a terrible toothache rather than brave a dental visit?
Thanks to sedation dentistry at [Gulch Dental Studio](/), you can now receive the dental care you need while remaining relaxed and comfortable.
Learn more about the sedation options available at our dental studio in Nashville, TN...

## What Is Sedation Dentistry?

Sedation dentistry includes a range of options designed to meet each patient's specific needs so that even those with dental phobias can receive proper care. Dentists typically describe sedation as having four levels: mild, moderate, deep, and general:

- Mild: Minimal sedation that calms you while you are awake, usually administered through nitrous oxide (laughing gas) or an oral sedative
- Moderate: You are conscious but will remember little of the procedure, which involves taking an oral sedative beforehand
- Deep: An intravenous (IV) sedative induces a state of near-sleep
- General anesthesia: Complete unconsciousness, which is often recommended for complex or lengthy procedures

No matter which sedation method is used, our dentists will also administer local anesthetic to numb the treatment area.

## Sedation at Gulch Dental Studio

At [our dental office in Nashville, TN](/), our dentists can provide nitrous oxide and oral sedation on their own. We are also one of the only dental practices in Nashville that partner with a doctor licensed to provide general anesthesia. If you have severe dental anxiety, or if you are going to require a lengthy procedure, we will invite our anesthesia specialist to your appointment.

Because we offer every level of sedation, we can ensure your comfort during any procedure, whether it's a simple [cleaning](/services/teeth-cleaning) or a complex [root canal.](/services/root-canal) Whenever you work with our dentists, you can expect to experience a patient-centered environment with a team of professionals dedicated to your health and well-being. We will go to great lengths to protect your safety and peace of mind.

## Who Is a Candidate for Sedation Dentistry? Consider Sedation If You Have...

### Dental Anxiety

Patients of all ages can feel nervous about dentistry. If you're afraid of visits to the dentist, don't be embarrassed. However, it is important to find a way to tolerate a dental appointment so that you can achieve and maintain good oral health. Sedation dentistry could be the solution that enables you to receive the dental care you need.

### Low Pain Tolerance

Some patients are more sensitive to discomfort than others. If your teeth and gums often hurt during a dental visit, talk to our dentists about sedation dentistry. Even a mild form of sedation will dull your senses for a more comfortable experience.

### Extensive Dental Issues

Patients with gum disease, dental infections, extensive decay, or missing teeth can require lengthy procedures. If your teeth or gums are in bad shape, sedation dentistry can help you stay calm and relaxed during a longer appointment. In some cases, you may be able to fall asleep and then wake up with a totally transformed smile.

### Sensitive Gag Reflexes

Patients who gag easily tend to find dental appointments very unpleasant. Sedation can temporarily weaken your gag reflex so that you can sit comfortably through your treatment. Plus, when you gag less, our dentists will be able to complete your visit in less time.

## Could Sedation Dentistry Be Right for You? Find Out in a Consultation

Does dentistry make you uneasy? We can make your next dental appointment calm and relaxing.

Thanks to our chic, modern office and state-of-the-art technology, an appointment with our dentists won't feel like any dental visit you've had before. Plus, we can help you remain calm and relaxed throughout your treatment with safely administered sedation dentistry.

To find out if sedation dentistry is right for you, schedule a consultation with our Nashville dentists. You can get in touch with us by [contacting us online](/consultation) or by calling:

Dr. Harris is seriously a magician. He is transforming my smile and I’m so happy with the progress so far. He’s been so helpful in getting everything finished before my wedding, too! Highly recommend.


Cory Owak


Gulch dental is like visiting family every time I go! Dr. Harris and all the staff are so nice and friendly. You can tell right from walking in the team is dedicated to creating a comfortable elevated experience.


## Sedation Dentistry Candidacy


Before you receive any type of sedation, our dentists will go over your medical history to determine which option would be safest and most appropriate for you. Some existing conditions, such as sleep apnea, should be disclosed and discussed prior to your procedure, as should any allergies or past negative reactions to anesthesia. If you have a history of substance abuse, sedation dentistry may not be a wise choice for you.

## Our Sedation Options

## Nitrous Oxide

The most well-known sedation method in dentistry, nitrous oxide is a clear, odorless gas that can be inhaled through a mask placed over the nose. Nitrous oxide is sometimes called "laughing gas" because it can make patients feel silly and giggly. Nitrous takes effect quickly and wears off quickly, so patients are able to drive themselves home after their treatment.

## Will Insurance Cover Sedation Dentistry?

Sedation dentistry is not usually covered by dental insurance, so you should expect your out-of-pocket expenses to increase if you choose sedation. We want you to have a great experience with dentistry, regardless of your budget, so we'll help you review your insurance plan to see if there are any benefits you can access related to sedation. We also offer financing options that can help you afford sedation dentistry. Contact us for more information about our financing plans.

Alicia Etter


I had my first appointment here recently and had a very good experience and this will be my new home dentist. This location is easy to get to, clean, and cute. The entire care team from the moment I walked into the door was friendly, knowledgeable, and very accommodating. My hygienist was super gentle, informative, kind, and thorough. This is important to me as I am a nervous patient when it comes time to go to the dentist. If you are in search of a new dentist, I do recommend this practice!

## Over 30 years of success for elite dental practices

In the 1990s, we introduced our first nationwide marketing campaigns for the Dental Industry. We began advertising on major search engines such as AOL, Alta Vista, Excite, Goto, Hotbot, Infoseek, Lycos, Looksmart, Webcrawler, and Netscape. At that time, the World Wide Web did not work well for local businesses. Our exclusive directories were designed to funnel global search traffic to our local service providers. Today, we continue to develop the most innovative solutions for the most elite practices in the world.

## Outsmart your competition with superior strategy.

Our proprietary eIQ Recommendation Engine gathers information from multiple apps to combine data into a single source, providing us with real-time insights and recommendations for our clients. Find out which page topics and keywords will help you get the best traffic and conversions for your specialty and location, and learn how your top competitors are achieving their results. Then, with the help of our SEO experts, we help you make profitable decisions to grow your practice and online presence.

## eIQ Recommendation Engine

Our proprietary eIQ Recommendation Engine allows us to analyze all the data that Google and other sources provide so we can understand search behavior, what your competitors are doing, and how your online marketing strategy measures up.

### Gather the Data

We compile data from a range of trusted sources, such as Google Analytics, Google AdWords, SEMRush, Searchmetrics, and Call Rail into our data lake via API using a powerful cloud collaboration platform.

### Demystify Search

We know what keywords people use for each topic, how many people are searching for each keyword, and how consumer searches are changing. This enables us to see exactly what's happening in your current market and how search behaviors shift over time.

### Analyze Your Competitors

To gain insight into what others are doing in your market, we analyze page stats, word counts for targeted topics, related keywords, and ranking data from the top-performing competitors for your topic and location.

### Evaluate Your Results

Once the competitor analysis is complete, we can compare your rankings, page stats, and other critical ranking elements with your competitors. This enables us to identify any shortcomings in your strategy.

### Identify Opportunities

The eIQ Recommendation Engine can identify the opportunities that are best for you and your situation. It connects the details of your practice and your budget to our data. We pinpoint what you’re missing, what your competitors have, and the level they're at for word count, citations, and other ranking factors.

### Get Recommendations

After identifying opportunities, we will create a strategy proposal to shrink the difference and outperform your competition. Your list of recommendations may include a premium page, blog post, Google Business Profile (GBP) buildout, GBP posts, and Google Ads on your investment topics so you can take up more real estate on Google.

## Our strategy enables you to take up more real estate on Google.

### Organic Results

You want to take advantage of all the ranking opportunities on Google. High rankings in the organic search results are a top priority. We may recommend boosting the word count on a page to meet the criteria set in your market or [creating new pages](/premium-seo-content) to achieve better organic rankings.

### Local Results

Almost half of Google searches have local intent. We capture these quality leads with robust profile creation and accurate category selection for your GBP profile. This can help you outperform your competition and bring your local and organic strategies into alignment.

### Google Ads Results

Our strategic Google Ads campaigns broaden your visibility at the lowest possible cost-per-click and cost-per-lead. By combining ads with organic and [local SEO](/local-seo), we can help you take up more high-value real estate on Google and increase your click-through rates.

### Porcelain Veneers

It’s no secret that [porcelain veneers](/services/veneers) are an important part of many of the beautiful smiles you see on television, magazine covers, and even in your day-to-day life.

Through the use of the best materials and refined artistic sensibilities, Dr. Newman can help you achieve the dazzling cosmetic upgrade you want in as little as two visits to his state-of-the-art dental practice.

### Dental Crowns

A broken or decayed tooth can cause pain, make chewing difficult, negatively impact your speech, and affect your self-esteem. Utilizing the same custom-made, high-quality ceramics from Macstudio laboratories that we use for veneers, our dentist can provide a crown that repairs and protects your smile. Dr. Newman uses IPS Empress® and e.max for [dental crowns in Nashville, TN](/services/dental-crowns/). These advanced glass-ceramic materials are designed to mimic the translucency of natural teeth and reflect light in a way that achieves very lifelike results. To provide you with the highest level of protection, both the IPS Empress and e.max ceramics have been refined for greater strength and durability when compared to other porcelain materials.
