Going to the dentist is probably one of my least favorite things to do. The staff and Dr. Harris were extremely welcoming and made me feel extremely comfortable. They were empathetic and worked with me to formulate a realistic plan. Overall, I had a great experience!

## Transform Your Smile Discreetly

### Invisalign Orthodontic Treatment

If the only thing keeping you from a celebrity smile is the thought of braces, step through the doors of Gulch Dental Studio, offering [Invisalign in Nashville, TN](/services/invisalign/). We can create the smile you've been dreaming of using comfortable aligners, the virtually invisible solution for straightening teeth.

Invisalign uses a series of clear aligner trays that gently move your teeth into the correct position, benefitting the health, function, and appearance of your smile.

To ensure the best possible result, our dentists use advanced imaging systems that capture 3D scans of your teeth. Our exacting methods allow us to precisely plot the movement of each tooth for predictable results. We'll even show you a digital preview of your new smile so you can make an informed decision.

![Young man holding Invisalign aligner at the dentist]()

## Do You Have a Complicated Case?

Advances in Invisalign technology now allow even people with complex cases to take advantage of clear aligners. But Gulch Dental Studio goes a step further to ensure megawatt smiles. While our dentists are certified Invisalign providers, our team also includes an orthodontic specialist who has the advanced training to handle difficult orthodontic cases.

Is it time to find out what makes clear aligners so popular among patients of all ages?

## Our Specialties

![Young woman smiling with a small picture of a veneer in the corner]()

## Porcelain Veneers

Stained, chipped, worn, or slightly crooked teeth affect not only your smile but also your confidence. The highly skilled dentists at Gulch Dental Studio can enhance your smile with ultra-thin dental veneers. We craft our custom [veneers in Nashville, TN,](/services/veneers/) with the finest materials, including IPS e.max® and IPS Empress®, which mimic the properties of natural enamel. This allows us to blend your new veneers with surrounding teeth for a seamless result. With the proper care, the highly advanced and exceptionally strong materials we use for our veneers can last over a decade.

![Middle-aged woman in Nashville smiling with a close-up of a crown in the corner]()

## Dental Crowns

If you suffer from broken, chipped, or missing teeth, our dentists can restore the appearance and function of your smile with our metal-free cosmetic crowns. A dental cap covers the visible portion of a tooth to reinforce and preserve its structure, restoring a damaged tooth to its normal function. We exclusively use the highest quality materials such as IPS e.max and IPS Empress for our [dental crowns in Nashville, TN,](/services/dental-crowns/) to closely match the natural shade of your smile. These state-of-the-art materials allow us to restore your smile so that you can eat and chew comfortably again and boost your confidence in your appearance.

![Mature woman with the Nashville skyline in the background and a small image of a botox bottle in the corner]()

## BOTOX® Cosmetic

If you feel self-conscious about signs of aging surrounding your smile, we can help. Our dentists offer BOTOX Cosmetic® treatments at our downtown Nashville, TN, office to minimize the lines and wrinkles that may make you look and feel older than you are. The entire treatment process is simple, virtually painless, and typically takes less than 15 minutes to administer. Results generally last about six months, which means you can effectively maintain your dental care and your youthful appearance during your biannual checkup. Ask about BOTOX Cosmetic at your next visit.

## Stress-Free Dental Care We Offer Every Level of Sedation

With our high-end, luxurious surroundings, Gulch Dental Studio envelopes patients in a serene setting. But if that is not enough to keep you relaxed during treatment, we also offer sedation dentistry carefully matched to your needs.

Gulch Dental Studio is one of the rare dental practices in Nashville that offers every level of sedation. That allows us to provide each and every patient with a Goldilocks solution for treatment: The "just right" level of sedation for the procedure they are having, or for their level of anxiety.

Our dentists are thoroughly trained in providing nitrous oxide and oral sedation. However, if you have severe anxiety, we will bring in a licensed anesthesiologist so that you can get the treatment you need without unnecessary discomfort, and in the utmost safety.

Having moved from Los Angeles in 2020 I had not been ready to visit a dentist in Nashville until today. Can’t believe I waited so long, almost felt like I was at a (tooth) spa! The dentist is very personable and geared to your individual needs. Jenna was my hygienist and was amazing, gentle yet super thorough. Wait for it, Dr. said I needed no treatment at my 50 years old I was excited to hear! And wait for it again, Dr. provides Botox cosmetic - I literally had the best dentist visit and got my eyebrows lifted in one hour!!!! If there was 10 stars I’d give 11
