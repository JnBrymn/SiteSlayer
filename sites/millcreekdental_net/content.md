HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices - Mill Creek Dental | Dentist in Nolensville TN


# HIPAA-Notice of Privacy Practices

Effective date of notice: 10/19/2009NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICESDr. Jared D Anway, DDS7269 Nolensville Rd, Nolensville TN, 37135615-776-1050615-776-1051[info@millcreekdental.net](mailto:info@millcreekdental.net)

### THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION.  PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.

We respect our legal obligation to keep health information that identifies you private. We are obligated by law to give you notice of our privacy practices. This Notice describes how we protect your health information and what rights you have regarding it.

TREATMENT, PAYMENT, AND HEALTH CARE OPERATIONS

The most common reason why we use or disclose your health information is for treatment, payment or health care operations. Examples of how we use or disclose information for treatment purposes are: setting up an appointment for you; examining your teeth; prescribing medications and faxing them to be filled; referring you to another doctor or clinic for other health care or services; or getting copies of your health information from another professional that you may have seen before us. Examples of how we use or disclose your health information for payment purposes are: asking you about your health or dental care plans, or other sources of payment; preparing and sending bills or claims; and collecting unpaid amounts (either ourselves or through a collection agency or attorney). “Health care operations” mean those administrative and managerial functions that we have to do in order to run our office. Examples of how we use or disclose your health information for health care operations are: financial or billing audits; internal quality assurance; personnel decisions; participation in managed care plans; defense of legal matters; business planning; and outside storage of our records.

We routinely use your health information inside our office for these purposes without any special permission. If we need to disclose your health information outside of our office for these reasons we will ask you for special written permission.

USES AND DISCLOSURES FOR OTHER REASONS WITHOUT PERMISSION

In some limited situations, the law allows or requires us to use or disclose your health information without your permission. Not all of these situations will apply to us; some may never come up at our office at all. Such uses or disclosures are:

when a state or federal law mandates that certain health information be reported for a specific purpose;

for public health purposes, such as contagious disease reporting, investigation or surveillance; and notices to and from the federal Food and Drug Administration regarding drugs or medical devices;

disclosures to governmental authorities about victims of suspected abuse, neglect or domestic violence;

uses and disclosures for health oversight activities, such as for the licensing of doctors; for audits by Medicare or Medicaid; or for investigation of possible violations of health care laws;

disclosures for judicial and administrative proceedings, such as in response to subpoenas or orders of courts or administrative agencies;

disclosures for law enforcement purposes, such as to provide information about someone who is or is suspected to be a victim of a crime; to provide information about a crime at our office; or to report a crime that happened somewhere else;

disclosure to a medical examiner to identify a dead person or to determine the cause of death; or to funeral directors to aid in burial; or to organizations that handle organ or tissue donations;

uses or disclosures for health related research;

uses and disclosures to prevent a serious threat to health or safety;

uses or disclosures for specialized government functions, such as for the protection of the president or high ranking government officials; for lawful national intelligence activities; for military purposes; or for the evaluation and health of members of the foreign service;

disclosures of de-identified information;

disclosures relating to worker’s compensation programs;

disclosures of a “limited data set” for research, public health, or health care operations;

incidental disclosures that are an unavoidable by-product of permitted uses or disclosures;

disclosures to “business associates” who perform health care operations for us and who commit to respect the privacy of your health information;

Unless you object, we will also share relevant information about your care with your family or friends who are helping you with your dental care.

APPOINTMENT REMINDERS

We may call or write to remind you of scheduled appointments, or that it is time to make a routine appointment. We may also call or write to notify you of other treatments or services available at our office that might help you. Unless you tell us otherwise, we will mail you an appointment reminder on a post card, and/or leave you a reminder message on your home answering machine or with someone who answers your phone if you are not home.

OTHER USES AND DISCLOSURES

We will not make any other uses or disclosures of your health information unless you sign a written “authorization form.” The content of an “authorization form” is determined by federal law. Sometimes, we may initiate the authorization process if the use or disclosure is our idea. Sometimes, you may initiate the process if it’s your idea for us to send your information to someone else. Typically, in this situation you will give us a properly completed authorization form, or you can use one of ours.

If we initiate the process and ask you to sign an authorization form, you do not have to sign it. If you do not sign the authorization, we cannot make the use or disclosure. If you do sign one, you may revoke it at any time unless we have already acted in reliance upon it. Revocations must be in writing. Send them to the office contact person named at the beginning of this Notice.

YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING YOUR HEALTH INFORMATION

The law gives you many rights regarding your health information. You can:

ask us to restrict our uses and disclosures for purposes of treatment (except emergency treatment), payment or health care operations. We do not have to agree to do this, but if we agree, we must honor the restrictions that you want. To ask for a restriction, send a written request to the office contact person at the address, fax or E Mail shown at the beginning of this Notice.

ask us to communicate with you in a confidential way, such as by phoning you at work rather than at home, by mailing health information to a different address, or by using E mail to your personal E Mail address. We will accommodate these requests if they are reasonable, and if you pay us for any extra cost. If you want to ask for confidential communications, send a written request to the office contact person at the address, fax or E mail shown at the beginning of this Notice.

ask to see or to get photocopies of your health information. By law, there are a few limited situations in which we can refuse to permit access or copying. For the most part, however, you will be able to review or have a copy of your health information within 30 days of asking us (or sixty days if the information is stored off-site). You may have to pay for photocopies in advance. If we deny your request, we will send you a written explanation, and instructions about how to get an impartial review of our denial if one is legally available. By law, we can have one 30 day extension of the time for us to give you access or photocopies if we send you a written notice of the extension. If you want to review or get photocopies of your health information, send a written request to the office contact person at the address, fax or E mail shown at the beginning of this Notice.

ask us to amend your health information if you think that it is incorrect or incomplete. If we agree, we will amend the information within 60 days from when you ask us. We will send the corrected information to persons who we know got the wrong information, and others that you specify. If we do not agree, you can write a statement of your position, and we will include it with your health information along with any rebuttal statement that we may write. Once your statement of position and/or our rebuttal is included in your health information, we will send it along whenever we make a permitted disclosure of your health information. By law, we can have one 30 day extension of time to consider a request for amendment if we notify you in writing of the extension. If you want to ask us to amend your health information, send a written request, including your reasons for the amendment, to the office contact person at the address, fax or E mail shown at the beginning of this Notice.

get a list of the disclosures that we have made of your health information within the past six years (or a shorter period if you want). By law, the list will not include: disclosures for purposes of treatment, payment or health care operations; disclosures with your authorization; incidental disclosures; disclosures required by law; and some other limited disclosures. You are entitled to one such list per year without charge. If you want more frequent lists, you will have to pay for them in advance. We will usually respond to your request within 60 days of receiving it, but by law we can have one 30 day extension of time if we notify you of the extension in writing. If you want a list, send a written request to the office contact person at the address, fax or E mail shown at the beginning of this Notice.

get additional paper copies of this Notice of Privacy Practices upon request. It does not matter whether you got one electronically or in paper form already. If you want additional paper copies, send a written request to the office contact person at the address, fax or E mail shown at the beginning of this Notice.

OUR NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES

By law, we must abide by the terms of this Notice of Privacy Practices until we choose to change it. We reserve the right to change this notice at any time as allowed by law. If we change this Notice, the new privacy practices will apply to your health information that we already have as well as to such information that we may generate in the future. If we change our Notice of Privacy Practices, we will post the new notice in our office, have copies available in our office, and post it on our Web site.

COMPLAINTS

If you think that we have not properly respected the privacy of your health information, you are free to complain to us or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights. We will not retaliate against you if you make a complaint. If you want to complain to us, send a written complaint to the office contact person at the address, fax or E mail shown at the beginning of this Notice. If you prefer, you can discuss your complaint in person or by phone.

# Family Dentistry

## Family Dentistry in Nolensville, TN

Do you need a dentist you can trust? Call Mill Creek Dental today!

Your dental care needs will change as you get older, and your family dentist will take that into account. Mill Creek Dental offers family dentistry for the whole family, ensuring that each member of your family gets the comprehensive care they need. Our dentists are compassionate, have worked with patients of all ages, and are experts at putting your mind at ease.

Whether you have just added a new member to your family or are looking for “the best family dentist near me,” Mill Creek Dental is here for you. We offer an extensive array of family dental services including, but not limited to:

- Dental Exams
- Dental Fillings
- Root Canals
- Dental Bridges

### [Dental Exams and Cleanings](https://millcreekdental.net/dental-exams-cleanings/)

Prevention is often better than a cure, which is why we recommend regular dental exams and cleanings every six months for all family members. These exams give our dentists a chance to examine your mouth and identify potential problems before they become severe. A regular exam is also a chance for our cleaning technicians to remove plaque and tartar using modern sonic methods.

Even if you brush and floss regularly, routine dental exams and cleanings can take your oral health to the next level and ensure that your teeth and gums stay healthy throughout your lifetime.

### [Dental Fillings](https://millcreekdental.net/services/composite-fillings/)

Most people will experience tooth decay at some point in their lives. Many factors, including accumulated bacteria, excess sugar, and poor oral hygiene, play a role in tooth decay.

Unfortunately, tooth decay is irreversible and will eventually lead to cavities. The best way to prevent cavities from spreading and causing more decay is to plug and seal them with a filling.

Dentists use several different materials for dental fillings, including gold, silver amalgam, and composite fillings. Your dentist at Mill Creek Dental will go over the advantages and disadvantages of every type of filling with you to enable you to choose the best option to meet your needs.

We can also use dental fillings as a way to repair a cracked or chipped tooth. This gives the tooth more support and helps it blend in with the rest of your teeth.

### [Dental Bridges](https://millcreekdental.net/services/dental-bridges/)

If you lose a tooth, you may find that eating and speaking become challenging and that the teeth around the hole start drifting into the space left by the lost tooth. To prevent this, we can provide a dental bridge.

A dental bridge is a prosthetic tooth that fits in the gap left behind by your original tooth. This not only makes your teeth look complete again, but it also helps you eat and speak more easily and prevents bacterial accumulation.

The dental bridge itself has two crowns that fit on the teeth on either side of the gap, with the replacement tooth in between. These crowns help support the new tooth while also keeping your teeth in their allocated places.

Installing dental bridges is a lengthy process that will take at least two appointments. If you need a dental bridge, your dentist will outline the process and provide you with the necessary preparation and aftercare to ensure a successful procedure.

### [Root Canals](https://millcreekdental.net/services/root-canals/)

The mere mention of the word ‘root canal’ can cause even the bravest person to break into a cold sweat. While this procedure was indeed tedious and painful in the past, modern dental practices have made it significantly less terrifying and much less painful.

Sometimes a tooth gets so severely decayed that it can become infected. If this infection travels to the tooth root, it can cause painful abscesses and other complications. The best way to save the tooth is to remove the nerve and pulp and then clean and seal off the inside of the tooth.

If your dentist recommends a root canal to save your tooth, be sure not to panic. We will walk you through the procedure and ensure your comfort throughout the process. Learn more about our [cosmetic dentistry services](https://millcreekdental.net/cosmetic-dentistry/).

Having a family dentist you can trust in Nolensville, TN will give you and your family peace of mind. If you want to find out about our family dentistry services or schedule an appointment, please call [Mill Creek Dental](https://millcreekdental.net/) at (615) 776 1050 or [fill out our contact form](https://millcreekdental.net/contact-us/) today!

Dental Exams & Cleanings Nolensville TN | Mill Creek Dental


# Dental Exams & Cleanings

## Dental Exams and Cleanings in Nolensville, TN

Keep your mouth feeling healthy and clean. Book a dental cleaning at Mill Creek Dental today!

Oral health is about more than just brushing teeth twice a day and the occasional floss. Routine checkups are essential in keeping teeth and gums in excellent shape and can help identify potential issues before becoming severe.

At [Mill Creek Dental](https://millcreekdental.net/), we offer a comprehensive and professional dental exam and teeth cleaning services in Nolensville, TN, that includes:

- cleaning
- preventative care
- X-rays
- oral cancer screenings

We generally recommend that our patients book a routine check every six months, but for those who have any oral health concerns, we recommend more frequent checks.

## Do I Really Need a Dental Exam?

Most people think that regular brushing and flossing is sufficient for oral health, so they tend to neglect their routine checkups. However, even the most vigorous routine cannot reach every part of your mouth, so bacteria and plaque will accumulate despite your best efforts.

At Mill Creek Dental, we have a wide range of cleaning equipment in our clinic that can penetrate hard-to-reach areas for a deep clean that will remove bacteria, plaque, and stains from your teeth.

Our dentists also use these regular checkups to evaluate your overall oral health. Most oral health issues only display symptoms when they become serious. Gum disease tends to be completely asymptomatic until you end up with bleeding, receding gums, or severe gum disease.

Our team of professional dentists is continuously on the lookout for potential symptoms of poor oral health. We can identify problems early, ensuring that they do not progress to become painful and expensive to treat.

## The Dental Exam and Cleaning Process

A routine dental exam and cleaning take around half an hour to complete. It consists of two portions, the exam and the cleaning.

### Dental Exam

The dental exam is where the dentist examines your mouth for cavities, gum disease, and other potential issues. We may use more specialized equipment to confirm our diagnosis, such as taking an X-ray for cavities.

The exam is also an excellent chance for you to chat with your dentist about oral health. Feel free to ask any questions about your current home routine or any concerns you may have about your teeth or gums.

### Teeth Cleaning

The second part of the exam is the cleaning itself. Our hygienists use a sonicator that produces high-frequency vibrations to dislodge and remove any accumulated plaque and tartar. This process can take anywhere between 10 and 20 minutes depending on the severity of the plaque build-up. Once complete, you’ll have a brighter smile and significantly cleaner teeth.

## Preventative Care

In addition to routine care, we also provide additional preventive care as necessary. This care can include:

- Fluoride treatment to reduce tooth sensitivity and strengthen your tooth surface
- Dental sealants to reduce the bacteria that accumulate in your back teeth
- Dental fillings to fill cavities and prevent additional tooth decay

Your dentist will advise if you need any of these additional treatments.

Be sure not to neglect to take care of your oral health. Schedule your regular checkup and dental cleanings in Nolensville, TN, by calling Mill Creek Dental at (615) 776-1050 or [fill out our contact form](https://millcreekdental.net/contact-us/) today!

Dental Fillings Nolensville TN | Tooth Fillings Nolensville TN | Mill Creek Dental


# Composite Fillings

## Dental Fillings

Most people will get a cavity in a tooth at some point in life. Cavities are damaged areas of a tooth created by decay. Excessive oral bacteria, improper oral hygiene, and eating sugar are usually the causes. The decay permanently damages tooth enamel and creates openings into the tooth.

Dental fillings are one of the most common ways that dentists treat cavities. The dentist will remove the damaged area and fill the void with cast gold, amalgams, or tooth-colored composite material. Amalgams or silver fillings were typical in the past, but composite fillings are more popular today because they make the damaged tooth look natural. They are also highly durable with a long lifespan.

Signs that you may have cavities in need of dental fillings include:

- tenderness when biting down
- tooth sensitivity to sweet foods or beverages
- feeling a rough patch around a tooth

You may also have difficulty clearing food away from a specific area inside your mouth because the hole catches the particles.

Cavities are not the only reason to receive dental fillings. This procedure is also beneficial to fill any hole in a tooth to prevent further decay.

Dental fillings consisting of white composite material may be a viable solution to preserve a fractured tooth. A dentist may also use dental fillings to give a damaged tooth additional support and enhance its appearance.

The process of receiving dental fillings is relatively simple. The dental team will begin by thoroughly examining your teeth to determine the source of your problem. If they notice signs of decay or cavities, the dentist will apply a local anesthetic before drilling away the damaged area.

Next, the dentist cleans the area and uses dental filling materials to pack the void, followed by adhesives and a composite material to protect and seal the filling.

To harden the soft dental filling and composite overlay, the dentist may use a bonding light.

The final step is to smoothe away any rough areas to ensure comfort.

Root Canals Nolensville TN | Root Canal Treatment Nolensville TN | Mill Creek Dental


# Root Canals

## Root Canal Treatment

Root canals are one of the most feared and misunderstood procedures in dentistry, but they shouldn’t be. Historically, a root canal required many long, tedious and often painful visits. Modern techniques allow for quick, highly successful, painless root canals to be completed in one visit.

A root canal is a treatment used to repair and save a tooth that is badly decayed or becomes infected. During a root canal procedure, the nerve and pulp are removed and the inside of the tooth is cleaned and sealed. Without treatment, the tissue surrounding the tooth will become infected and abscesses may form.

“Root canal” is the term used to describe the natural cavity within the center of the tooth. The pulp or pulp chamber is the soft area within the root canal. The tooth’s nerve lies within the root canal.

A tooth’s nerve is not vitally important to a tooth’s health and function after the tooth has emerged through the gums. Its only function is sensory — to provide the sensation of hot or cold. The presence or absence of a nerve will not affect the day-to-day functioning of the tooth.

Dental Bridges Nolensville TN | Teeth Bridges Nolensville TN | Mill Creek Dental


# Dental Bridges

## Dental Bridges

When you have one or more missing teeth, [Dr. Jared Anway](https://millcreekdental.net/) may close the gap with a dental bridge in Nolensville TN. Dental bridges are an oral prosthetic, or pontic, that permanently replaces missing teeth. A bridge will improve your bite and preserve the natural curves of your face. With proper maintenance, the lifespan of dental bridges can exceed 10 years.

Regardless of how you lose a tooth, your remaining teeth near the void left by the lost tooth could begin to shift and drift into the empty area unless you seek a dentist for a solution like a dental bridge. This change can affect how you bite and chew, and it may produce additional stress on your jaw joints and teeth. The shifted teeth are also more difficult to clean, which can further affect your oral health by putting your mouth at risk of gum disease and tooth decay.

A dental bridge consists of two or more connected crowns designed to fit your teeth. The dentist will place the crown on an abutment or anchoring tooth on either side of the space, along your gum line. The abutment teeth then form a bridge to allow the pontic to fill in to create a row of natural-looking teeth.

Getting a dental bridge requires two or more dentist visits. During the first visit, usually a consultation, Dr. Jared Anway will file down the enamel on the anchor teeth around the space where the tooth is missing until they resemble small stubs. The team will then take a mold of your mouth, which the dental laboratory will use to create a custom crown.

Until the next appointment, when you receive your permanent dental bridge, you will temporarily wear removable bridges. At the next visit, after removing the temporary bridge and cleaning the area underneath, Dr. Anway will permanently affix the customized pontic onto the abutment teeth. Follow-up appointments will ensure that your dental bridge fits well and that you have necessary aftercare information.

## Nolensville Cosmetic Dentistry: Love Your Smile

Fix cosmetic dental issues and get a whiter, brighter smile. Call today to book an appointment at (615) 819-1895.

If you’re unhappy with the appearance of your smile, we can help. At [Mill Creek Dental](https://millcreekdental.net/), we offer a wide range of comprehensive cosmetic dental services in Nolensville, TN. Dr. Anway can transform your smile, resolving issues such as discoloration, tooth gaps or chips, and more. We settle for nothing less than excellence!

If you’re ready to get the smile you’ve always wanted, book an appointment with our office today. One of our friendly team members will set you up with a hassle-free appointment whenever it’s most convenient for you.

### Teeth Whitening

While diet and lifestyle choices can affect the color of your teeth, time alone takes its toll. Teeth whitening is one of the easiest options to improve your smile’s appearance. Our [Philips Zoom take-home whitening](https://millcreekdental.net/services/teeth-whitening/) kit will help you whiten your teeth whenever and wherever you want!

During your whitening consultation, we’ll collect a bit of information to help us determine which treatment will achieve the best results. We have two take-home kits are available:

Philips Zoom DayWite

- Use once a day for 30-90 minutes over two weeks.
- Ideal if you’d like to wear your whitening plates as little as possible.

Philips Zoom NiteWite

- Use every day for 2-4 hours, or overnight for two weeks.
- Ideal if you’d prefer not to wear plates during the day.

Both options are safe, convenient, and won’t damage your teeth. To get your kit, call today to schedule a consultation with Dr. Anway.

### Inlays & Onlays

Similar to a filling but stronger, dental inlays and onlays treat varying levels of surface-level decay. Think of them as a mid-range option between a filing and a crown.

Onlays are larger and typically used on the cusp, or pointed portion of teeth, while inlays are smaller and usually used in the indentions of teeth. Both restorations are made of the same material and serve the same purpose.

With either option, any decay will also be removed before the inlay or onlay is placed, meaning these procedures aren’t solely cosmetic. They also can help stop tooth decay and help keep your teeth healthy!

[Inlays and Onlays](https://millcreekdental.net/services/inlays-onlays/) can be made of tooth-colored material, which is virtually indistinguishable from your natural teeth, and are made based on a mold of your actual teeth.

If your tooth decay is impacting the appearance of your teeth, reach out today to book a hassle-free appointment with our team in Nolensville!

### Veneers

One of the most versatile cosmetic dental procedures, veneers can be used to address a wide range of issues, including gaps, surface damage, discoloration, crooked, and misshapen teeth.

[Veneers](https://millcreekdental.net/veneers/) are not fake teeth. They are thin pieces of material that cover the front of your teeth to hide any decay or gaps in your smile. Dr. Anway, along with our skilled team, will create and attach a veneer to reshape your teeth, giving you the flawless, pearly-white smile that you’ve always wanted.

Getting veneers will require at least two sessions. First, you will need to schedule a consultation to determine if veneers are the right choice for you. We’ll give you an honest evaluation of what veneers can and can’t achieve and take impressions of your current teeth.

The process and number of appointments after that will depend on the type and number of veneers you chose. No matter what, you can count on our team to find the right cosmetic dental procedures to achieve your goals.

Call Mill Creek Dental today at (615) 819-1895 or [fill out our contact form](https://millcreekdental.net/contact-us/) to work with the best cosmetic dentist in Nolensville, TN!

## Types of Veneers

In an aim to fix any smile at any budget, we offer two different types of veneers. Porcelain veneers are the most common, but you can also opt for composite resin veneers to help mask damage to your teeth. We’ll discuss your options with you in-depth during your consultation, but here’s a bit more about each option:

### Porcelain Veneers

Porcelain veneers resist staining and look much more natural than resin veneers. We craft them to perfectly match the color of your teeth, and they reflect light naturally, so your smile looks bright and natural.

The downside to porcelain veneers is that they can be a bit more expensive than resin veneers. Porcelain veneers will last a bit longer, though, so they can cost less in the long run.

Porcelain veneers are best for:

- Long-lasting, natural results
- Durability

### Resin/Composite Veneers

Resin veneers are less common than porcelain veneers here in Nolensville, but they can be done in a single visit and are easier to repair than porcelain.

They are also less expensive than porcelain veneers, but you will need to have them replaced more frequently. Resin stains easily as well, so you’ll need to take care when drinking things like coffee or red wine.

Resin veneers are best for:

- Those looking for low upfront costs
- Quick results

## Getting Veneers in Nolensville: How It Works

Regardless of what type of veneers you choose, you will need a minimum of two appointments with our cosmetic dentist, Dr. Anway. The first appointment will be a consultation to determine which kinds of veneers you need.

After completing your first appointment, you will need to return to have your teeth reshaped so that we can attach your veneers. Composite veneers can often be completed in the second appointment, but porcelain veneers may require an additional appointment. The number of veneers you opt for will also play a role.

We’ll follow-up with you shortly after your final appointment to ensure you’re nothing less than thrilled with your new smile—we strive for nothing short of excellence.

If you’re interested in getting veneers in Nolensville, TN, call Mill Creek Dental today at (615) 819-1895 or [fill out our contact form](https://millcreekdental.net/contact-us/) to book an appointment. We also offer a wide range of other cosmetic dental procedures!

Dental Crowns Nolensville TN | Tooth Crowns Nolensville TN | Mill Creek Dental


# Dental Crowns

## Dental Crowns in Nolensville, TN

Dental crowns are a powerful cosmetic and restorative tool for treating teeth that have been significantly damaged, or decayed, Dental crowns fit perfectly over your tooth, covering it from the top to below the gum line. The crown is bonded to your tooth.

A crown is recommended in the following situations:

- Root canal restoration (Endodontic procedure)
- Tooth weakened by numerous amalgam fillings
- Cusp fracture of a tooth
- Cosmetic restoration of a tooth unsuited for veneering
- Neuromuscular Full Mouth
- Reconstructions will sometimes feature crowns to permanently correct bite issues.

In all these cases, your dental crown will fit completely over your tooth, making it more attractive, protecting it against further damage and decay, and providing it with fully functional chewing surfaces.

### Dental Crowns

Crown Types

There are three types of crowns available for use in dental restorations today:

Metal Crowns

All-metal crowns are primarily functional restorations. Their only functional lack is that they conduct heat very well, and can sometimes make a tooth sensitive to temperature extremes, although this is generally not a problem in root canal procedures where the root of the tooth has been removed. Gold is an exceptional material for restoring back teeth due to its inherent qualities. It is extremely durable especially when subjected to the stresses and strains of chewing. The needed thickness to achieve this durability is relatively low, meaning less tooth structure is removed in preparing teeth for gold crowns. The soft, pliable nature of gold allows for a very precise fit and is very gentle to the opposing teeth resulting in a very long-lasting choice of restoration

Porcelain Crowns

All-porcelain crowns are both functional and aesthetic restorations. Porcelain crowns can, in many cases, blend in completely in your mouth, making them undetectable. All-porcelain crowns can also be very convenient. With our new CEREC machine, all-porcelain restorations can be crafted while you wait, so there is no need to take an impression of your teeth, then wait while the restoration is made. Instead, the CEREC machine uses a CAD/CAM system to manufacture the all-porcelain crown within minutes. To learn more about this exciting technology and how it has revolutionized the process of making dental restorations see our CEREC link.

Combination Crowns

Porcelain fused to metal crowns is both functional and aesthetic restorations. A porcelain-fused-to-metal crown (PFM) could be considered to be a hybrid of the other types of crowns, in the sense that it is composed of two different types of materials. One is a metal alloy that is used to create that portion of the crown that fits directly on the tooth. The other is porcelain. The porcelain forms the tooth-shaped aspect of the crown and gives the crown a white tooth-like coloration. The PFM is often used when destructive night grinding is a problem or when long-span bridges are needed.
