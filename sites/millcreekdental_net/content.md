# Dental Crowns

## Dental Crowns in Nolensville, TN

Dental crowns are a powerful cosmetic and restorative tool for treating teeth that have been significantly damaged, or decayed, Dental crowns fit perfectly over your tooth, covering it from the top to below the gum line. The crown is bonded to your tooth.

A crown is recommended in the following situations:

- Root canal restoration (Endodontic procedure)
- Tooth weakened by numerous amalgam fillings
- Cusp fracture of a tooth
- Cosmetic restoration of a tooth unsuited for veneering
- Neuromuscular Full Mouth
- Reconstructions will sometimes feature crowns to permanently correct bite issues.

In all these cases, your dental crown will fit completely over your tooth, making it more attractive, protecting it against further damage and decay, and providing it with fully functional chewing surfaces.

### Dental Crowns

#### Crown Types

There are three types of crowns available for use in dental restorations today:

#### Metal Crowns

All-metal crowns are primarily functional restorations. Their only functional lack is that they conduct heat very well, and can sometimes make a tooth sensitive to temperature extremes, although this is generally not a problem in root canal procedures where the root of the tooth has been removed. Gold is an exceptional material for restoring back teeth due to its inherent qualities. It is extremely durable especially when subjected to the stresses and strains of chewing. The needed thickness to achieve this durability is relatively low, meaning less tooth structure is removed in preparing teeth for gold crowns. The soft, pliable nature of gold allows for a very precise fit and is very gentle to the opposing teeth resulting in a very long-lasting choice of restoration

#### Porcelain Crowns

All-porcelain crowns are both functional and aesthetic restorations. Porcelain crowns can, in many cases, blend in completely in your mouth, making them undetectable. All-porcelain crowns can also be very convenient. With our new CEREC machine, all-porcelain restorations can be crafted while you wait, so there is no need to take an impression of your teeth, then wait while the restoration is made. Instead, the CEREC machine uses a CAD/CAM system to manufacture the all-porcelain crown within minutes. To learn more about this exciting technology and how it has revolutionized the process of making dental restorations see our CEREC link.

#### Combination Crowns

Porcelain fused to metal crowns is both functional and aesthetic restorations. A porcelain-fused-to-metal crown (PFM) could be considered to be a hybrid of the other types of crowns, in the sense that it is composed of two different types of materials. One is a metal alloy that is used to create that portion of the crown that fits directly on the tooth. The other is porcelain. The porcelain forms the tooth-shaped aspect of the crown and gives the crown a white tooth-like coloration. The PFM is often used when destructive night grinding is a problem or when long-span bridges are needed.

# Root Canals

## Root Canal Treatment

Root canals are one of the most feared and misunderstood procedures in dentistry, but they shouldn’t be. Historically, a root canal required many long, tedious and often painful visits. Modern techniques allow for quick, highly successful, painless root canals to be completed in one visit.

A root canal is a treatment used to repair and save a tooth that is badly decayed or becomes infected. During a root canal procedure, the nerve and pulp are removed and the inside of the tooth is cleaned and sealed. Without treatment, the tissue surrounding the tooth will become infected and abscesses may form.

“Root canal” is the term used to describe the natural cavity within the center of the tooth. The pulp or pulp chamber is the soft area within the root canal. The tooth’s nerve lies within the root canal.

A tooth’s nerve is not vitally important to a tooth’s health and function after the tooth has emerged through the gums. Its only function is sensory — to provide the sensation of hot or cold. The presence or absence of a nerve will not affect the day-to-day functioning of the tooth.

# Teeth Whitening

Philips Zoom take-home tooth whitening kits are a safe and convenient way to get your smile noticeably whiter in one to two weeks. You’ll get professional, affordable results with little to no sensitivity.

#### Why choose a Philips Zoom take-home kit?

You apply our take-home whitening kits yourself, meaning you can get whiter teeth when and where you want.

To ensure you have a safe and comfortable experience, all our tooth whitening treatments start with a consultation with your dentist. They will prescribe the best whitening kit for your teeth, and answer any questions you may have. Then you’ll be fully armed with the knowledge to safely and effectively whiten your smile at home.

#### What happens during my whitening consultation?

When you book your appointment, tell the dental practice that you’re interested in a Philips Zoom whitening treatment. When you arrive, you’ll be asked what sort of treatment you want. Perhaps you want the fastest results? Or something that’s extra gentle on your teeth? Or if you’re not sure, simply ask your dentist what they recommend.

If you are prescribed a treatment that uses mouth trays, we will make you a customized tray that fits perfectly to your teeth and gum line, so you get safe and effective results.

# Composite Fillings

## Dental Fillings

Most people will get a cavity in a tooth at some point in life. Cavities are damaged areas of a tooth created by decay. Excessive oral bacteria, improper oral hygiene, and eating sugar are usually the causes. The decay permanently damages tooth enamel and creates openings into the tooth.

Dental fillings are one of the most common ways that dentists treat cavities. The dentist will remove the damaged area and fill the void with cast gold, amalgams, or tooth-colored composite material. Amalgams or silver fillings were typical in the past, but composite fillings are more popular today because they make the damaged tooth look natural. They are also highly durable with a long lifespan.

Signs that you may have cavities in need of dental fillings include:

- tenderness when biting down
- tooth sensitivity to sweet foods or beverages
- feeling a rough patch around a tooth

You may also have difficulty clearing food away from a specific area inside your mouth because the hole catches the particles.

Cavities are not the only reason to receive dental fillings. This procedure is also beneficial to fill any hole in a tooth to prevent further decay.

Dental fillings consisting of white composite material may be a viable solution to preserve a fractured tooth. A dentist may also use dental fillings to give a damaged tooth additional support and enhance its appearance.

The process of receiving dental fillings is relatively simple. The dental team will begin by thoroughly examining your teeth to determine the source of your problem. If they notice signs of decay or cavities, the dentist will apply a local anesthetic before drilling away the damaged area.

Next, the dentist cleans the area and uses dental filling materials to pack the void, followed by adhesives and a composite material to protect and seal the filling.

To harden the soft dental filling and composite overlay, the dentist may use a bonding light.

The final step is to smoothe away any rough areas to ensure comfort.

# Dental Bridges

## Dental Bridges

When you have one or more missing teeth, [Dr. Jared Anway](https://millcreekdental.net/) may close the gap with a dental bridge in Nolensville TN. Dental bridges are an oral prosthetic, or pontic, that permanently replaces missing teeth. A bridge will improve your bite and preserve the natural curves of your face. With proper maintenance, the lifespan of dental bridges can exceed 10 years.

Regardless of how you lose a tooth, your remaining teeth near the void left by the lost tooth could begin to shift and drift into the empty area unless you seek a dentist for a solution like a dental bridge. This change can affect how you bite and chew, and it may produce additional stress on your jaw joints and teeth. The shifted teeth are also more difficult to clean, which can further affect your oral health by putting your mouth at risk of gum disease and tooth decay.

A dental bridge consists of two or more connected crowns designed to fit your teeth. The dentist will place the crown on an abutment or anchoring tooth on either side of the space, along your gum line. The abutment teeth then form a bridge to allow the pontic to fill in to create a row of natural-looking teeth.

Getting a dental bridge requires two or more dentist visits. During the first visit, usually a consultation, Dr. Jared Anway will file down the enamel on the anchor teeth around the space where the tooth is missing until they resemble small stubs. The team will then take a mold of your mouth, which the dental laboratory will use to create a custom crown.

Until the next appointment, when you receive your permanent dental bridge, you will temporarily wear removable bridges. At the next visit, after removing the temporary bridge and cleaning the area underneath, Dr. Anway will permanently affix the customized pontic onto the abutment teeth. Follow-up appointments will ensure that your dental bridge fits well and that you have necessary aftercare information.

# Periodontal Treatment

## Periodontal Disease Treatment

Periodontal disease is a bacterial infection that penetrates into the gums and into the bone around your teeth, causing inflammation. Periodontal inflammation leads to bone loss and possibly tooth loss and may contribute to other medical conditions.

The periodontal infection must be removed and the area given a chance to heal. There are generally two levels of gum disease treatment for this condition depending upon the severity of your infection.

### Upper Level Infection Removal

The upper level of infection in the pockets around your teeth can be removed using specialized instruments. This procedure is called, “Scaling and Root Planing”. It is done under local anesthesia and is quite different from a routine dental cleaning. This is followed by a localized treatment of antibiotics “Arestin” to the infected areas.

### Symptoms of Periodontal Infection

Periodontal infection is usually painless until it reaches an advanced stage. However, there are some symptoms that can indicate the presence of periodontal infection.

These may include:

- Red or swollen gums
- Bleeding when brushing (pink toothbrush), or at other times
- Aching, itchy, sore or tender gums
- Receding gums (teeth beginning to look longer)
- Pus between your teeth and gums when you press down on the gums
- Bad breath
- Any change in the way your teeth fit together when you bite
- Any change in the fit of partial dentures
- Loose, separating or protruding teeth
- Spaces between teeth

If you notice any of the above warning signs of periodontal infection, please [contact our office](https://millcreekdental.net/contact-us/) at 615-776-1050 and ask for a periodontal evaluation.

# Inlays & Onlays

### Dental Onlays

Whereas dental inlays are designed to treat decay within the cusps, or top projections, of a tooth, onlays are used to treat decay that extends to one or more of the cusps. Onlays are placed in much the same way as inlays. First, an impression of the decayed tooth is taken, and a temporary onlay is placed over the tooth. The impression is then sent to a lab, where a dental technician creates the onlay according to the tooth’s dimensions. When the patient returns to the dentist’s office, the temporary onlay is removed, and the permanent restoration is placed on the tooth and securely bonded using high-strength dental resins.

Like dental inlays, onlays can be created from tooth-colored material, which makes them virtually undetectable to the naked eye. Onlays also help to conserve more tooth structure because their use requires minimal removal a tooth’s surface. Perhaps their most important benefit, however, is that, in saving damaged teeth, onlays help patients avoid the eventual need for more extensive treatment with dental crowns, dental bridges, or dental implants.

### Dental Inlays

Dental inlays are used to treat teeth that have decay or damage lying within their indented top surfaces. They can also be used to replace old or damaged metal fillings. Inlay placement is usually carried out over two appointments. During your first visit to the dentist, an impression of your tooth will be taken, and a temporary inlay will be placed over the tooth. The dentist will send the impression off to a dental lab, which will create the inlay to match your tooth’s specifications. When you return to the dentist’s office, the temporary inlay will be removed and the permanent one will be placed carefully over your tooth. There is no downtime after receiving a dental inlay, only a mild level of tenderness in the treated area, so you can return to work or other activities as soon as you leave the office.

Examples of how we use or disclose your health information for payment purposes are: asking you about your health or dental care plans, or other sources of payment; preparing and sending bills or claims; and collecting unpaid amounts (either ourselves or through a collection agency or attorney). “Health care operations” mean those administrative and managerial functions that we have to do in order to run our office. Examples of how we use or disclose your health information for health care operations are: financial or billing audits; internal quality assurance; personnel decisions; participation in managed care plans; defense of legal matters; business planning; and outside storage of our records.

We routinely use your health information inside our office for these purposes without any special permission. If we need to disclose your health information outside of our office for these reasons we will ask you for special written permission.

#### USES AND DISCLOSURES FOR OTHER REASONS WITHOUT PERMISSION

In some limited situations, the law allows or requires us to use or disclose your health information without your permission. Not all of these situations will apply to us; some may never come up at our office at all. Such uses or disclosures are:

when a state or federal law mandates that certain health information be reported for a specific purpose;

for public health purposes, such as contagious disease reporting, investigation or surveillance; and notices to and from the federal Food and Drug Administration regarding drugs or medical devices;

disclosures to governmental authorities about victims of suspected abuse, neglect or domestic violence;

uses and disclosures for health oversight activities, such as for the licensing of doctors; for audits by Medicare or Medicaid; or for investigation of possible violations of health care laws;

disclosures for judicial and administrative proceedings, such as in response to subpoenas or orders of courts or administrative agencies;

disclosures for law enforcement purposes, such as to provide information about someone who is or is suspected to be a victim of a crime; to provide information about a crime at our office; or to report a crime that happened somewhere else;

disclosure to a medical examiner to identify a dead person or to determine the cause of death; or to funeral directors to aid in burial; or to organizations that handle organ or tissue donations;

uses or disclosures for health related research;

uses and disclosures to prevent a serious threat to health or safety;

uses or disclosures for specialized government functions, such as for the protection of the president or high ranking government officials; for lawful national intelligence activities; for military purposes; or for the evaluation and health of members of the foreign service;

disclosures of de-identified information;

disclosures relating to worker’s compensation programs;

disclosures of a “limited data set” for research, public health, or health care operations;

incidental disclosures that are an unavoidable by-product of permitted uses or disclosures;

disclosures to “business associates” who perform health care operations for us and who commit to respect the privacy of your health information;

Unless you object, we will also share relevant information about your care with your family or friends who are helping you with your dental care.

#### APPOINTMENT REMINDERS

We may call or write to remind you of scheduled appointments, or that it is time to make a routine appointment. We may also call or write to notify you of other treatments or services available at our office that might help you. Unless you tell us otherwise, we will mail you an appointment reminder on a post card, and/or leave you a reminder message on your home answering machine or with someone who answers your phone if you are not home.

#### OTHER USES AND DISCLOSURES

We will not make any other uses or disclosures of your health information unless you sign a written “authorization form.” The content of an “authorization form” is determined by federal law. Sometimes, we may initiate the authorization process if the use or disclosure is our idea. Sometimes, you may initiate the process if it’s your idea for us to send your information to someone else. Typically, in this situation you will give us a properly completed authorization form, or you can use one of ours.

If we initiate the process and ask you to sign an authorization form, you do not have to sign it. If you do not sign the authorization, we cannot make the use or disclosure. If you do sign one, you may revoke it at any time unless we have already acted in reliance upon it. Revocations must be in writing. Send them to the office contact person named at the beginning of this Notice.

#### YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING YOUR HEALTH INFORMATION

The law gives you many rights regarding your health information. You can:

ask us to restrict our uses and disclosures for purposes of treatment (except emergency treatment), payment or health care operations. We do not have to agree to do this, but if we agree, we must honor the restrictions that you want. To ask for a restriction, send a written request to the office contact person at the address, fax or E Mail shown at the beginning of this Notice.

ask us to communicate with you in a confidential way, such as by phoning you at work rather than at home, by mailing health information to a different address, or by using E mail to your personal E Mail address. We will accommodate these requests if they are reasonable, and if you pay us for any extra cost. If you want to ask for confidential communications, send a written request to the office contact person at the address, fax or E mail shown at the beginning of this Notice.

ask to see or to get photocopies of your health information. By law, there are a few limited situations in which we can refuse to permit access or copying. For the most part, however, you will be able to review or have a copy of your health information within 30 days of asking us (or sixty days if the information is stored off-site). You may have to pay for photocopies in advance. If we deny your request, we will send you a written explanation, and instructions about how to get an impartial review of our denial if one is legally available. By law, we can have one 30 day extension of the time for us to give you access or photocopies if we send you a written notice of the extension. If you want to review or get photocopies of your health information, send a written request to the office contact person at the address, fax or E mail shown at the beginning of this Notice.

ask us to amend your health information if you think that it is incorrect or incomplete. If we agree, we will amend the information within 60 days from when you ask us. We will send the corrected information to persons who we know got the wrong information, and others that you specify. If we do not agree, you can write a statement of your position, and we will include it with your health information along with any rebuttal statement that we may write. Once your statement of position and/or our rebuttal is included in your health information, we will send it along whenever we make a permitted disclosure of your health information. By law, we can have one 30 day extension of time to consider a request for amendment if we notify you in writing of the extension. If you want to ask us to amend your health information, send a written request, including your reasons for the amendment, to the office contact person at the address, fax or E mail shown at the beginning of this Notice.

get a list of the disclosures that we have made of your health information within the past six years (or a shorter period if you want). By law, the list will not include: disclosures for purposes of treatment, payment or health care operations; disclosures with your authorization; incidental disclosures; disclosures required by law; and some other limited disclosures. You are entitled to one such list per year without charge. If you want more frequent lists, you will have to pay for them in advance. We will usually respond to your request within 60 days of receiving it, but by law we can have one 30 day extension of time if we notify you of the extension in writing. If you want a list, send a written request to the office contact person at the address, fax or E mail shown at the beginning of this Notice.

get additional paper copies of this Notice of Privacy Practices upon request. It does not matter whether you got one electronically or in paper form already. If you want additional paper copies, send a written request to the office contact person at the address, fax or E mail shown at the beginning of this Notice.

#### OUR NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES

By law, we must abide by the terms of this Notice of Privacy Practices until we choose to change it. We reserve the right to change this notice at any time as allowed by law. If we change this Notice, the new privacy practices will apply to your health information that we already have as well as to such information that we may generate in the future. If we change our Notice of Privacy Practices, we will post the new notice in our office, have copies available in our office, and post it on our Web site.

#### COMPLAINTS

If you think that we have not properly respected the privacy of your health information, you are free to complain to us or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights. We will not retaliate against you if you make a complaint. If you want to complain to us, send a written complaint to the office contact person at the address, fax or E mail shown at the beginning of this Notice. If you prefer, you can discuss your complaint in person or by phone.
