Hi Dr. Anway,

I’ve been reviewing Mill Creek Dental’s website, and it’s clear you and your team put a lot of care into making patients feel comfortable and informed—whether it’s a first visit or in-depth procedures like crowns and root canals.

I’m Zac, founder of SlayDigital.ai, where we build simple, custom AI web agents that let site visitors chat directly with your existing website content for fast answers—no bots or canned scripts, just helpful support.

I put together a quick example using a mock version of your website:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/millcreekdental_net  
There’s a chat icon in the bottom-right; click it to open the box and start typing. The agent responds with accurate information pulled from your own site.

You can try asking it questions like:
- What insurances do you accept?
- How do I schedule a new patient exam?
- What should I expect during a teeth whitening appointment?
- Are dental crowns or veneers right for me?
- How does the billing and cancellation policy work?

This could help reduce repetitive calls and make it easier for both new and returning patients to get key answers—any time, without digging or waiting.

If you’d like to see how this could work on your actual site, just let me know. No pressure—happy to answer any questions you might have!

Best,  
Zac Slay
