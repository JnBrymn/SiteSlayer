Hi Dr. Anway,

I hope you’re doing well! I came across Mill Creek Dental’s site and was impressed by your focus on patient comfort, honest treatment plans, and community connection. It’s clear you put a lot of care into making sure every patient feels at ease—especially those new to the area or anxious about dental visits.

I’m Zac, founder of SlayDigital.ai. We help practices like yours make their websites more helpful with a simple addition: a custom AI-powered web agent. This tool sits quietly in the corner of your site and instantly answers common patient questions, using your actual site content—no confusing tech talk, just patient-friendly info.

Here’s a live mockup using your website: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/millcreekdental_net  
To try it, just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner. Type any question, and the agent replies based on details already on your site.

You can try asking things like:
- “What insurance do you accept?”
- “How do I schedule my first exam and cleaning?”
- “What should I expect during a root canal?”
- “What are your office hours?”
- “How does teeth whitening work at your practice?”

This could help your team cut back on repetitive calls and let patients get clear, friendly answers anytime—without hunting through multiple pages.

If you think this could be useful for Mill Creek Dental, just let me know. I’d love to hear what you think, or answer any questions you have.

Warm regards,  
Zac Slay
