SUBJECT: Helping New Patients Get Answers Instantly at Mill Creek Dental

-----------------------------------------
Hi Dr. Anway,

I appreciate how Mill Creek Dental makes newcomers feel at home and emphasizes trust and clarity in patient care. I’d love to help you make it even easier for patients to get detailed answers—directly from your own website.

I’m Zac, founder of SlayDigital.ai. We create custom AI website agents that let visitors chat with your site’s existing content—helping them find info quickly without waiting for a call-back or digging through pages.

Here’s a quick demo, using a mock version of your website:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/millcreekdental_net  
Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right, and type a question to see answers pulled right from your site.

You can try asking things like:
- Do you accept Metlife or Cigna dental insurance?
- What kind of crowns do you offer, and how long do they take?
- How does your teeth whitening process work?
- What should I do if my gums are bleeding or painful?
- Are you accepting new patients, and how do I book an appointment?

I think this could help your team save time, reduce repeat calls, and help new patients feel confident in choosing Mill Creek Dental.

Let me know if you’d like to chat or see more—happy to customize for your practice’s needs.

Warm wishes,  
Zac
