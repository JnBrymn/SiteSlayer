## Read our patient reviews

I got to say something nobody usually gets to say today. I had the BEST dentist appointment! Going to the dentist is usually an anxiety ridden task (scary/pointy metal tools) but Dr. Hall and her staff were so friendly and it made you feel like you were hanging out with friends instead of being at the dentist. The wait was short to be seen, and Dr. Hall met with me right away to discuss any concerns. Wendy did my cleaning and she was so fun and friendly and made the time pass really quickly. I would definitely recommend Katherine Hall to anyone.

My first dental appointment since moving to Nashville a few month’s ago. Scheduler was very accommodating. Upon arrival, greeted professionally. Hygienist was comprehensive and thorough. Dr Hall has a very welcoming approach. Great experience and I highly recommend!

### Dennis

My experiences with Dr. Hall and her staff have always surpassed my expectations. I have never been shamed for being nervous about procedures (I had some childhood dentist experiences that I haven’t been able to shake). I’ve been her patient for 15+ years and Dr. Hall has never recommended procedures or fillings that I don’t truly need.

### Replacing Missing Teeth With Dental Implants

If you're missing teeth, you're not alone. Tooth loss is a far more common problem than you think. In fact, studies
show that 178 million people across the United States are missing at least one tooth, and 35 million are completely
edentulous (missing all their teeth). Whether you have lost one tooth or multiple ones to gum disease, tooth decay,
or a traumatic injury, the office of Katherine Hall DDS can help. We provide state-of-the-art care and offer the
latest solutions to help patients reestablish complete, healthy, and beautiful smiles.

Dental implants for a smile that looks and feels completely natural!

Today, dental implants represent the most advanced system for the replacement of missing teeth. While conventional
[fixed bridges](../dental-bridges/) and dentures remain effective and satisfying ways to replace
missing teeth, dental implants come the closest to replicating the look, feel, and function of a natural smile.

With dental implants, you can once again enjoy all your favorite foods and speak and smile with renewed confidence
and ease. Because dental implants behave in much the same way as the roots of natural teeth, they provide unrivaled
stability for the placement of a broad range of dental prostheses, including
[crowns](../ceramic-crowns/) and [bridges](../dental-bridges/) up to a complete set of
teeth. For patients who wear [full dentures](../dentures/), dental implants provide the added stability and
retention required to improve comfort and fit while preventing any embarrassing slippage.

If you are struggling with tooth loss and looking for the best solutions for the replacement of missing teeth, visit
the office of Katherine Hall DDS to learn more about dental implants and all the state-of-the-art services we
provide. At the office of Katherine Hall DDS, we take pride in creating beautiful and healthy smiles!

Dental implant basics

Dental implants are small, biocompatible surgical posts that behave in much the same way as the roots of natural teeth. Once placed and integrated with the surrounding bone, dental implants provide unparalleled support for single crowns, bridges, and dentures. As the most advanced method for the replacement of missing teeth, they offer satisfying, long-lasting, and functional solutions for rebuilding a complete smile.

Consider all the benefits

Whether you’re missing one tooth, multiple ones, or missing all your teeth, you can rebuild a complete and beautiful smile with dental implants! According to statistics, roughly 3 million people have already received dental implants, with that number increasing at a staggering rate of 500,000 per year! The soaring popularity of dental implants is attributed, in large part, to the numerous benefits they offer as compared with other methods of care.

While conventional fixed bridges and dentures provide effective and satisfying solutions for the replacement of missing teeth, dental implants offer several advantages over traditional methods of care:

- Dental implants come the closest to replicating the look, feel, and function of natural teeth.
- With precise placement, good oral hygiene, and routine care, dental implants can last for many years.
- Dental implants provide continued stimulation to the underlying bone to prevent the bone loss that occurs when teeth are missing while preserving natural facial contours.
- Since implants behave like natural teeth, there is no chance that they will slip or dislodge like removable dentures when speaking or eating.
- Dental implants make it possible to speak with ease and eat and taste all types of food with virtually no restrictions.
- Dental implants do not decay and will not develop cavities.
- Unlike a fixed bridge, dental implants do not require any preparation or crowning of teeth adjacent to the edentulous area.

### The Most Versatile Solution for The Replacement Of Missing Teeth

Types of Dental Implants:

- Single-tooth implantWhen a single tooth is missing, a dental implant restored with a crown replicates a natural tooth in almost every way. It’s no longer necessary to fabricate a conventional three-unit bridge involving the preparation and crowning of any adjacent teeth. As a self-supporting and fully functional entity, a single tooth implant offers patients an excellent solution for reestablishing a complete and attractive smile.
- Implant-supported fixed bridgesAs used to replace two or more missing teeth, an implant-supported bridge preserves the integrity of the adjacent natural teeth while providing the ongoing bone stimulation needed to prevent bone shrinkage and maintain facial contours. Unlike a traditional fixed bridge to replace multiple missing teeth, an implant-supported bridge does not require the preparation and crowning of any adjacent natural teeth. Instead, it relies on a select amount of strategically placed dental implants to support all the crowns and replacement teeth needed.
- Full arch replacement with four or six ImplantsServing as an alternative to full dentures, a complete set of replacement teeth supported by strategically placed implants successfully reestablishes a smile that looks, feels, and functions like a natural one. Unlike conventional dentures, this approach offers a fixed solution that’s both stable and non-removable. While eliminating the need for messy denture adhesives and having to take any dentures out to clean and sanitize them, it boosts confidence as one speaks, smiles, and chews. It also permits the immediate placement of an attractive set of temporary teeth, with a permanent set to follow once the implants become fully integrated with the surrounding bone.
- Implant-retained dentureAs the name implies, this type of denture attaches to a select number of strategically placed implants in the upper or lower jaw. These small surgical posts provide precise points of attachment for the overlying denture and add a significant measure of stability and retention. This added level of security enables one to smile, speak, and eat with greater confidence and ease.

Are dental implants right for me?

If you are wondering if you’re a candidate for dental implants, it’s easy enough to find out. At the office of Katherine Hall DDS, we’re not only happy to look at your smile, but we’ll also answer all your questions and explain your best options for dental implants. We treat every smile as unique and develop personalized treatment plans based on your medical and dental histories, current oral health, cosmetic expectations of care, lifestyle, and budget.

How are dental implants placed?

It’s essential to plan and meticulously execute every step in care, from initial treatment planning and the precise placement of dental implants all the way to the design, fabrication, and insertion of the final crowns, bridges, or dentures.

Surgery to place dental implants is typically considered a minor surgical procedure and performed on an outpatient basis. However, the exact extent of the procedure depends upon the type and number of dental implants and whether or not any additional procedures are required to prepare the supporting bone.

We view communication as a vital part of patient care. Before your dental implant procedure, we’ll discuss dental anesthesia, options for dental sedation, and provide detailed pre-op and post-op care instructions. You can count on our office to keep you well-informed every step of the way.

Once a dental implant gets placed, it takes a few months to integrate fully with the surrounding bone. While a few implant solutions allow placing a same-day temporary crown or bridge, others require waiting for complete healing and osseointegration (fusion with the surrounding bone) to place the permanent prostheses.

Why might I need a bone graft to get a dental implant?

According to clinical studies, dental implants have a demonstrated long-term success rate of well over 95%. However, the long-term stability and success of a dental implant depend upon the presence of sufficient bone at the time of placement. In cases of periodontal disease or following the extraction of a tooth, bone volume is often lost. By placing a bone graft in the extraction site, or prior to the placement of a dental implant, we can establish sufficient bone support for a sturdy and stable dental implant.

Let The Office Of Katherine Hall DDS Help You Rebuild A Beautiful Smile

Missing teeth do more than cause embarrassing gaps in your smile. For one thing, they can also affect your ability to speak or chew nutritious food with ease. By not replacing missing teeth, the adjacent ones can shift towards the space over time and change your bite and compromise the health of your smile in many ways.

With all of the advances in dental materials, technology, and treatment methods available today, it’s easier than ever before to replace missing teeth with the most natural-looking and aesthetically pleasing results of care.

At the office of Katherine Hall DDS, we’re pleased to offer leading solutions to improve your oral health and give you a smile you can feel confident sharing with the world. We give you back the complete smile you have lost and provide personalized solutions for all of your oral healthcare needs. To find out more about dental implants or schedule an appointment so that we can take a closer look at your smile, give us a call today.


### Frequently Asked Questions

What is the best method of replacing missing teeth? Are dental implants worth it?
+

If you've lost a tooth due to injury, decay, gum disease, or any other reason, we recommend dental implants to replace missing teeth. Dental implants come the closest to replicating the look, feel, and function of your natural teeth.

Are dental implants painful?

Dental implants are placed into the jawbone and mirror the same function as the root of a tooth. The procedure for dental implants is usually performed while a patient is sedated. Patients who undergo IV sedation must have an empty stomach and transportation home following the procedure. Most sedation patients will have little to no memory of the procedure occurring.

What are dental implants made of?

Generally, dental implants are made out of a biocompatible metal such as titanium. Biocompatible metals are also used for other common bone implants (such as shoulder, hip, and knee replacements). The visible portion of the implant is usually made out of porcelain and is custom-made to match your existing teeth.

Are dental implants permanent?

Dental implants are designed to fuse to the bone, which makes them become permanent fixtures. Typically speaking, the success rate is nearly 100%. There are few cases in which the implant will not fuse as intended and must be removed. If this happens to occur, the procedure can be attempted again a few months later.

Are dental implants expensive?

Dental implants are not usually covered by dental insurance, but may be covered under a patient's medical insurance. Our office and your insurance company can discuss coverage options with you based on your individual case and treatment plan.

How do I care for my dental implants?

It's easy... just take care of an implant as if it's a natural tooth! This involves regular brushing, flossing, and dental checkups. If you have any concerns about your implant, contact us immediately.


Ceramic Dental Crowns in Nashville, TN | Katherine Hall DDS


# Ceramic Dental Crowns in Nashville


At the office of Katherine Hall DDS, we’ve established a reputation for excellence based upon providing skilled and
experienced state-of-the-art care. We’re dedicated to keeping pace with the latest technology and advances in
treatment to provide our patients with the highest quality of care.

Despite the fact that dental enamel is stronger than bone and the hardest substance in your body, your teeth remain
vulnerable to cavities and trauma. While [dental fillings](../dental-fillings/) can provide an excellent way to repair a decayed or damaged
tooth, they don’t always provide the right solution for rebuilding a strong, functional one. When too much tooth
structure is compromised by dental decay, trauma, [root canals](../root-canals/), or habitual clenching and grinding, a filling just
won’t do. In these situations, a dental crown provides a better way to restore
the involved tooth's integrity, function, and appearance.

Thanks to advances in dental ceramics, dental crowns today don’t have to be fabricated from metal or have a metal
substrate. We can now fabricate all-ceramic crowns that offer the benefits of being metal-free, durable,
long-lasting, and as beautiful as a natural tooth.

At the office of Katherine Hall DDS, patient care, comfort, and satisfaction are our top priorities. We personalize
every treatment plan to address our patients’ oral healthcare needs and fulfill their cosmetic expectations of care.

### Why you may need a dental crown

Successful outcomes of care depend on careful treatment planning and paying close attention to a patient’s smile
goals and expectations of care. Whether you need a dental crown or one of the many other services we provide, you
can count on our office to explain your best options in care and to address all your questions and concerns every
step of the way.

A dental crown is a full-coverage restoration that replicates the form and function of a natural tooth. It’s often
recommended in the following the situations:

- To repair and rebuild a tooth with extensive structural damage due to decay or trauma
- To replace a large or broken [filling](../dental-fillings/)
- To restore a [dental implant](../implant-dentistry/)
- To provide full coverage for the abutment teeth, serving as the supporting ends of a traditional dental bridge
- To strengthen and protect a tooth that has undergone [root canal](../root-canals/) therapy
- To improve the look of an undersized, slightly misaligned, darkly stained, or misshapen tooth
- To address bite discrepancies

### What are the benefits offered by ceramic crowns?

Out of all the available materials for a full-coverage restoration today, metal-free crowns, also known as
all-ceramic crowns, offer the most lifelike and biocompatible results. Once commonly referred to as “porcelain
jackets,” today’s all-ceramic crowns are fabricated from the most advanced generations of cosmetically appealing,
durable, and natural-looking materials. With strength comparable to traditional metal and porcelain fused to metal
crowns, all-ceramic crowns provide a highly satisfying and long-lasting option in care.

As the name implies, the term all-ceramic crown means the crown's entire thickness is 100% ceramic. While in the
past, porcelain or all-ceramic crowns looked better but did not offer the strength and durability of porcelain fused
to metal crowns, it’s no longer the case. Thanks to advances in dental materials, they are stronger and more
reliable than ever before.

Here are just some of the reasons we recommend an all-ceramic crown:

- All-Ceramic crowns interact with light in much the same way as natural teeth and more closely mimic their translucency and luster
- All-Ceramic crowns can be made thinner and require less reduction and preparation of the underlying tooth
- All-Ceramic crowns are lighter in weight than dental crowns that incorporate a metal substructure
- All-Ceramic crowns are also kinder to the surrounding soft tissues.
- All-Ceramic crowns are resistant to stain and discoloration
- All-Ceramic crowns are metal-free and safer for individuals with allergies or sensitivities to metal
- All-Ceramic crowns resemble a natural tooth in its entirety and do not have a metal margin, which is often visible at the gumline

### The type of ceramic crown selected depends on your needs

You can rest assured that your new ceramic crown will look naturally beautiful and blend seamlessly with your smile.
Our office never compromises on service or materials; your new crown is milled from the latest generation of durable
ceramic materials, for the most aesthetically pleasing and natural-looking results.

With the range of dental ceramics available today, which type gets selected to fabricate your new crown depends upon
the tooth's location, the stresses on that tooth, and the case's aesthetic requirements. Certain types of
all-ceramic crowns are more suited to provide the strength needed for back teeth, while other types better address a
front tooth's aesthetic requirements. Although Feldspathic porcelain has been traditionally used in the fabrication
of porcelain crowns, today, newer generations of dental ceramics provide options that work for the front teeth as
well as the back teeth.

Some of the most popular and effective choices include the following:

- Lithium Disilicate Porcelain Crowns
- Leucite Reinforced Pressable Porcelain Crowns

How does a crown differ from a filling?

While a dental filling is designed to replace a portion of a decayed or damaged tooth, a dental crown offers full
coverage to restore the tooth’s entire outer surface. A well-fitting dental crown not only protects and strengthens
the underlying tooth structure, but it also restores the tooth’s appearance and function.

What's the procedure for getting an all-ceramic crown?

The procedure for getting an all-ceramic crown is much like the procedure for getting any other type of crown. In
all cases, the tooth needs to be prepared, an impression taken, and a permanent crown cemented into place. A single
all-ceramic crown can typically be fabricated over the course of two visits. However, with CAD/CAM technology, a
same-day crown can be fabricated from start to finish in a single visit. With the first approach, a temporary crown
is typically worn until the second visit, when the permanent restoration is placed. As with every treatment plan,
our office will explain your best options in care.

What's the difference between a temporary crown and a permanent crown?

As the name implies, a temporary crown is only worn for a short time until the permanent crown is placed. A
temporary crown is typically fabricated from durable tooth-colored dental acrylics. While designed to protect the
underlying tooth between appointments, and until your new permanent crown gets placed, a temporary crown is also
fabricated to look like a natural tooth and maintain the look of your smile.

Will my tooth feel any different?

While you should feel better having an attractive and functional tooth to restore your smile, your tooth may feel a
little sensitive following treatment. This initial sensitivity will subside. We take great care to make sure your
new restoration looks great, fits well, and your bite is perfect. However, we’re always happy to make any minor
adjustments to ensure your comfort.

Does a tooth that has had a root canal procedure need a crown?

With some exceptions, teeth with root canal procedures are typically restored and protected from further damage with
a full-coverage crown. Based on what’s best for your smile, our office will recommend the most appropriate
restoration to maintain the health and longevity of your tooth following a root canal procedure.

How do I take care of my new crown?

A dental crown is a long-term restoration that, if properly cared for, can serve you well for many years to come.
Once your new crown is placed, it requires the same brushing, flossing, and periodic checkups as your natural teeth.
Avoid biting your fingernails and chewing on hard or sticky objects such as ice, pencils, or taffy, which can damage
or loosen your crown. Remember, clenching and grinding your teeth puts excessive pressure on both natural teeth and
dental restorations. Unless treated, this habit can compromise the longevity and integrity of your dental work,
including crowns.

Does a crown protect my tooth from cavities and gum disease?

Although your new all-ceramic crown restores the tooth's strength, form, and function, you can still develop dental
disease in the absence of proper care. To prevent gum disease and tooth decay, it’s essential to brush and floss as
instructed and see our office for routine checkups, cleanings, and care.

How long do all-ceramic crowns last?

How long a dental crown lasts depends on various factors, including your level of oral care, diet, and oral habits.
While the standard answer is that dental crowns can last anywhere from 5 to 15 years, existing literature confirms
that most dental crowns remain in place at 15 to 20 years.

How much do all-ceramic dental crowns cost?

At the office of Katherine Hall DDS, we strive to provide the highest quality of care to address all
your dental needs. Once we’ve had the opportunity to examine your smile, we can give you a clear picture of any
dental issues that are present, along with a quote for how much treatment will be. The cost of dental crowns can
vary a little, depending on the type of crown and its location. Our goals are to provide the highest quality of care
and help patients begin treatment without additional financial stress or delay. We’re always happy to answer all
your questions on dental insurance coverage, available financing, and payment plans.

Does dental insurance cover all-ceramic crowns?

Coverage for all-ceramic crowns depends on your dental insurance plan. Today, many dental plans provide some level
of coverage for all-ceramic crowns. At the office of Katherine Hall DDS, we work with patients to
optimize their dental benefits and get the care they need to maintain healthy and beautiful smiles!

LisaGoogle

I love coming here! The staff are always friendly and helpful, my teeth are immaculately cleaned and Dr Hall is consistently professional and friendly!! I highly recommend this practice

MollyYelp

I used to genuinely hate going to the dentist, but Katherine Hall is a different story. The whole experience, from the friendly receptionists to the absolutely wonderful dental hygienists (I always have Sarah!) to Dr. Hall herself has changed my perspective on going to the dentist. My teeth are now in much better shape, not only because they do such a great job there, but because the friendly, comfortable atmosphere encourages repeat visits. No more avoiding the dentist - now I actually look forward to going!

DavidGoogle

I was referred to Dr. HALL by a dentist who worked for her when he was going to dentist school. I have enjoyed going here. Dr. Hall is very good and professional and is very good about making sure you are satisfied with the work she has done. The staff is very and make your visit very comfortable.

TessaYelp

I have not gone to the dentist for an embarrassingly long time, and I chose Dr. Hall's practice because of the amazing reviews online. I had very high expectations simply because of all the wonderful things I had heard about this practice. My experience absolutely lived up to my expectations: the office was very beautiful and professional looking, and the staff was all extremely friendly, from the receptionists to the hygienists and Dr. Hall herself. Everyone was extremely thorough, and I could not have asked for a better dentists appointment! I am usually very skeptical about dentists overcharging or suggesting unnecessary procedures, but I know Dr. Hall is genuinely invested in my dental health, and I was never under the impression that I should get a second opinion. I will continue to trust Dr. Hall and her fantastic team for all of my dental needs!

DannyGoogle

Dr Hall and her staff has provided dental care for my family for many years. Always prompt and professional and compassionate. Whether it’s just a cleaning or serious dental care, Dr Hall has always been there for us. She also treats TMJ for my wife. Not all dentists are able to provide this type of specialty. You will find Dr Hall very courteous and respectful. Her downtown office is easy accessible with paid parking for her patients. I’m a realist and tell it like it so.. Dr Hall is a great dentist!

Dental Hygiene Videos | Katherine Hall DDS


# Dental Hygiene Videos

### Bridges

Fixed dental bridges involve the preparation and crowning of teeth on either side of an area missing teeth to support artificial teeth to span the edentulous area.

A fixed bridge is a non-removable appliance fabricated to replace missing teeth, which closely resembles a patient’s natural dentition. Besides serving to restore the appearance and performance of a complete smile, a fixed bridge also prevents teeth that are adjacent to or opposite the edentulous area from shifting to protect the integrity of the occlusion. Fixed bridges are strong, durable and natural looking restorations, which once they are permanently cemented into place allow all manner of normal oral function.

### Brushing

Maintaining a healthy smile depends upon keeping your teeth and gums clean with a daily routine of brushing and flossing. According to the recommendations of the American Dental Association, it is important to brush your teeth at least twice a day for two minutes each time with a soft bristled toothbrush. Remember to use a soft bristled toothbrush and apply gentle pressure so as not to cause damage to your teeth or gums. Brushing your teeth with a fluoride containing toothpaste that has been awarded American Dental Association seal of acceptance helps to keep your smile healthy and vibrant. Remember to change your toothbrush every three months or when the bristles are frayed.

### Crowns

Once commonly referred to as, "porcelain jackets," today's all-ceramic crowns are fabricated from advanced generations of aesthetically appealing, lifelike materials affording strength and durability approaching that of tradition metal and porcelain fused to metal crowns (PFM).

When a tooth requires a full coverage restoration to rebuild its structural integrity and appearance, how good the crown will look and how well it will withstand the forces of oral function are major considerations in choosing the type of crown. In the past, only metal crowns or ones fabricated out of porcelain fused to an underlying substructure of metal offered the strength required to bite and chew without breaking. While porcelain fused to metal crowns to this day remain a popular choice for strong, attractive and long-lasting restorations to rebuild teeth that are damaged, decayed, misshapen, worn down, undersized, or have had a root canal procedure, there are some drawbacks. For one thing, the thin metal margin at the collar of a PFM crown may be visible at the gumline (especially in the presence of receding gums). Also, due to the presence of an underlying metal shell, porcelain fused to metal crowns do not come close to handling light in the same way as natural tooth structure or dental ceramics.

### Extractions

Sometimes it is necessary to extract a tooth. This can happen for a variety of reasons. Extractions are commonly performed in cases where a deciduous "baby" tooth is reluctant to fall out, a severely broken down and non-restorable tooth is present, or "wisdom tooth" is poorly positioned and unable to fully erupt into place.

### Fillings

With advances in dental materials and science, restorative materials that are aesthetically pleasing as well as strong and durable are widely available for the filling and repair of teeth that have been affected by tooth decay or dental injuries.

Composite fillings, which are frequently referred to as either "tooth colored fillings" or "white fillings," are a combination of biocompatible resins and finely ground, glass-like filler materials. Composite fillings, which are manufactured in a complete range of natural looking shades, provide a more cosmetically pleasing alternative to traditional "silver" fillings. Often used to fill a tooth by replacing tooth structure that is missing due to injury or decay, dental composites can also be placed to modify a tooth’s color or shape to dramatically improve its appearance as well as repair dental defects and close gaps between the teeth.

### Home Tooth Whitening

A teeth whitening procedure or bleaching simply refers to any process that will make the teeth appear whiter. It is considered a non-invasive procedure that is designed to whiten and brighten teeth that are stained, discolored, darkened, or yellowed. First introduced to the public in the 1980’s, the popularity of teeth whitening products and procedures has soared. According to a survey conducted by the American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry, when respondents were asked, "What would you like to improve most about your smile?" The most common response was: whiter and brighter teeth.

A home whitening system from the dentist along with custom trays that have been fitted to the teeth is also an excellent option. Custom trays keep the bleaching agent in maximum contact with the teeth and away from the other areas of the mouth. With a take-home teeth whitening system, maximum results are less rapid than an in office procedure and are typically achieved over a longer period of time. A home whitening system can be used by itself or as recommended by the dentist as a follow up to an in office procedure in order to perfect or maintain the results.

### Implants

Dental implants represent the most recent and advanced method of replacing lost or missing teeth. Invented in 1952 by a Swedish surgeon named Per-Ingvar Brånemark, dental implants today offer a highly effective, long-term solution for replacing missing teeth to reestablish a fully functional and attractive smile. Dental implants can be used to replace a single tooth, multiple teeth or all of the upper and/or lower teeth.

A dental implant is a small, biocompatible post that is surgically positioned by means of a minimally invasive procedure into the jawbone beneath the gums. Once healing takes place and the implant integrates with the bone, it behaves in much the same way as the root of a natural tooth to provide support for an aesthetically appealing dental crown or bridge. A period ranging from 3 to 6 months is required for the jawbone to fuse with the implant via a process known as osseointegration.

### Periodontal Disease

Periodontal disease damages the surrounding soft tissues and bone that support the teeth. It is predominantly caused by the accumulation of bacteria, mucus and other particles in the form of plaque or tartar that sit between the teeth and the gums. Periodontal disease can range in severity from a simple gum inflammation, known as gingivitis, to a more serious inflammation of the periodontal tissues. Left untreated periodontal disease can result in significant tissue damage and eventual tooth loss.

### Veneers

For teeth with imperfections that cannot be addressed with teeth whitening procedures, but are not so flawed as to require full coverage crowns, dental veneers can provide the desired cosmetic improvements.

Dental veneers are custom-fabricated facings that offer a conservative and cosmetically pleasing way to improve the appearance of teeth that are chipped, gapped, worn, slightly crooked, misshapen or darkly stained. With dental veneers, the color, shape, size, and length of the teeth can be changed for the better. Bonded to the front surfaces of the teeth, veneers can be used to enhance the appearance of a single tooth or multiple anterior teeth.

### Wisdom Teeth

Wisdom teeth, which are also known as the third molars, are the last permanent teeth to develop in the oral cavity as well as the final ones to come into place. However, as is often the case, many wisdom teeth do not have sufficient room to erupt, are not developing properly, or are causing issues for the adjacent teeth and the surrounding tissues. Oral and maxillofacial surgeons frequently see patients with impacted or problematic wisdom teeth for an evaluation or extractions as indicated.

## Compelling and Comprehensive Online Presence for Dental Practices with DoctorsInternet

In the fast-paced world of digital evolution, dental practices are increasingly recognizing the necessity of establishing a strong online presence. This digital footprint is not just about being found; it's about creating a compelling narrative around your brand, building credibility, and engaging with your target audience in meaningful ways. At DoctorsInternet, we specialize in crafting bespoke digital experiences for dental practices that not only attract attention but also drive conversions and foster loyalty. Our approach is holistic, merging innovative web design with strategic marketing to ensure your practice stands out in the crowded digital landscape.

### The Bedrock of Brand Credibility: Professional Website Design

First impressions are lasting impressions, especially online, where engagement begins with a single click. A professionally designed website is your practice’s digital handshake, instantly establishing professionalism and trust. This trust is foundational, not only for attracting new patients but for retaining them. At DoctorsInternet, we recognize that a dental website is more than just a digital brochure; it's a platform that reflects your practice's ethos, expertise, and commitment to patient care.

Crafting a dental website that resonates with visitors requires a deep understanding of your practice's unique value proposition. Our team dives deep into what sets your practice apart, translating these insights into a visually stunning and intuitive web experience. This personalized approach ensures that your website not only looks great but also performs optimally, facilitating a seamless user journey from the first click to the final conversion.

### A Digital Strategy That Drives Demand

Digital marketing has revolutionized how dental practices connect with their audiences. Gone are the days of relying solely on traditional advertising channels with their often prohibitive costs and uncertain returns. In contrast, digital channels offer targeted, measurable, and cost-effective ways to reach potential patients. At DoctorsInternet, we leverage a blend of SEO, pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, social media marketing, and content marketing to enhance your online visibility and attract a wider audience.

Our approach is data-driven, focusing on what works best for your practice and your audience. By continuously analyzing performance data, we refine our strategies to ensure maximum impact. Whether it's optimizing your website for search engines, crafting engaging social media campaigns, or developing compelling content, our goal is to drive meaningful engagement that translates into increased patient appointments and revenue growth for your practice.

### Embracing the Mobile Revolution: Responsive Design

The shift towards mobile browsing is undeniable. Today, more people access the internet via smartphones and tablets than ever before, making responsive web design an absolute must. A responsive website automatically adjusts its layout, content, and functionality to fit the screen it's being viewed on, providing an optimal browsing experience for all users.

At DoctorsInternet, we design websites with mobile users in mind from the outset. Our websites are sleek, fast, and intuitive, ensuring that your practice remains accessible and engaging, no matter how your audience chooses to connect. This commitment to excellence in user experience is a testament to our understanding of the digital landscape and its ever-evolving nature.

### Comprehensive Digital Marketing: A Holistic Approach

Our expertise extends far beyond website design. DoctorsInternet is a full-service digital marketing agency, offering end-to-end solutions tailored to the unique needs of dental practices. From SEO strategies that boost your visibility in search results to social media management that enhances your brand presence, we cover all bases. Our suite of services also includes Google Maps optimization, reputation management, and email marketing, ensuring a cohesive and comprehensive digital marketing strategy.

Content is king, and at DoctorsInternet, we have a dedicated team of healthcare writers producing original, informative, and engaging content. This content is not just filler; it's designed to engage your audience, showcase your expertise, and improve your website's ranking on search engines. Whether it's detailed service pages, informative blog posts, or compelling social media content, we create narratives that resonate with your audience and drive engagement.

Our approach is collaborative and transparent, involving you at every step to ensure that our efforts align perfectly with your vision and objectives.

### SEO: The Keystone of Digital Visibility

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is at the heart of our digital marketing strategy. We conduct thorough keyword research to understand how potential patients are searching for dental services online. This insight allows us to optimize your website's content, meta tags, and even its structure, ensuring that your practice ranks highly on search engine results pages (SERPs) for relevant queries. High visibility in search results is essential for attracting new patients, as most people rarely look beyond the first page of Google.

### Pay-Per-Click Advertising: Immediate Visibility and Traffic

While SEO is a long-term strategy, pay-per-click (PPC) advertising offers an immediate boost in visibility and traffic. Our PPC experts craft targeted ad campaigns that appear at the top of SERPs, driving potential patients to your website. By carefully selecting keywords and crafting compelling ad copy, we ensure that your PPC campaigns are cost-effective, delivering the highest possible return on investment.

### Social Media Marketing: Building Relationships and Brand Loyalty

Social media platforms offer a unique opportunity to build relationships with your audience. Our social media strategies are designed to engage with your current and prospective patients, fostering a sense of community around your brand. Through regular posts, engaging content, and interactive campaigns, we help you build brand loyalty and keep your practice top of mind.

### Content Marketing: Engaging and Educating Your Audience

Content marketing is all about providing value to your audience. Whether through informative blog posts, detailed service descriptions, or engaging videos, our content marketing efforts are designed to educate your audience about dental health and the services you offer. This not only helps establish your practice as a trusted authority in the dental field but also improves your SEO by increasing the amount of relevant, keyword-rich content on your website.

### Email Marketing: Keeping Your Practice on Your Patients' Minds

Dental email marketing is a powerful tool for keeping in touch with your patients and reminding them of the services you offer. Whether it's a monthly newsletter, appointment reminders, or special promotions, our email marketing services help keep your practice on your patients' minds. By providing timely, relevant, and valuable information, we help you maintain a strong relationship with your patient base.

### Continuous Improvement and Optimization

The digital landscape is constantly evolving, and so are our strategies. We continuously monitor the performance of your website and marketing campaigns, using data-driven insights to make informed adjustments. This process of continuous improvement ensures that your online presence remains effective and competitive, adapting to changes in technology, search engine algorithms, and user behavior.

### Azadeh Akhavan, DDS

This dental office is located in New York City and you are immediately made aware of that on the homepage of the site. The address is displayed at the very top of the website and large scale images of the city are also featured. Right beneath the banner, there are three square buttons which direct prospective patients to important areas of the site: the New Patients page, the Appointment page, and the Reviews page. This doesn't leave the site user searching all over to find the things that are likely most important to them. The site also lays out the practice's area of expertise right on the homepage so that a patient knows what they specialize in without having to do in-depth research to figure it out.

Generally speaking, those that are more involved with the building of the website end up with more customized websites.

+How do I get dental patients to my website?

Once the website is designed and approved by you, we will launch the website and optimize it properly for the search engines. Once Google indexes the website, we will have to build authority for your business and domain. Over time, you will start moving higher in placement on search engines and more potential patients will visit your website.
