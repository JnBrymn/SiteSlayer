SUBJECT: A simple way to answer patient questions right on your website

-----------------------------------------

Hi Dr. Hall,

I’m reaching out because your practice’s commitment to patient comfort and personalized care at Katherine Hall DDS really stands out. I noticed how thorough your site is in explaining services, insurance, and what to expect—and how much value you place on patient education.

I wanted to introduce SlayDigital.ai. We build custom, easy-to-use AI chat agents that live right on your website and answer common visitor questions using your existing content—helping patients quickly find helpful info without extra calls or emails for your staff.

To show what this could look like, we’ve set up a demo using your site’s content:  
https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/katherinehalldds_com  
Just click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner, type a question, and the agent will reply using info already on your site.

You can try asking things like:
- “What do I need to bring as a new patient?”
- “Do you accept my dental insurance plan?”
- “How do I request an appointment?”
- “What’s the difference between a dental crown and a filling?”
- “Is there free parking near your office?”

We aim to make it easier for patients to get clear answers—while freeing up your team for what matters most. If you’d like to discuss how this could help your office (or want feedback on the demo), just let me know. No obligation.

Warm regards,  
Zac
