SUBJECT: Make Answers Easy for Your Dental Patients—See a Simple Demo

Hi there,

I know that for both new and existing patients, quick answers make a big difference in their dental experience. At SlayDigital.ai, we build simple, custom AI website agents that help visitors instantly get information from your own site—24/7, without extra effort for your staff.

Here’s a live demo with your content: https://slaydigital.fly.dev/site/katherinehalldds_com  
Just click the chat icon at the bottom-right corner and type a question—patients will get clear, friendly answers pulled right from your site.

You can try asking things like:
- What is the best number to call for new patient appointments?
- Where is your office located?
- Do you accept emergency dental visits?
- What insurance plans do you take?
- What are your office hours?

If you’d like to see how this could help your team and patients, just reply—I’m happy to talk or set up a sample for you.

Best,  
Zac Slay
